While the idea of the filter bubble, in which people
are sheltered from challenging and disagreeable
information online, is a valid concern for democracy,
it requires much theoretical sophistication and
empirical support. This paper explores the extent
and scope of the filter bubble, employing the concept
of “cross-cutting exposure,” or exposure to
disagreeable viewpoints, on social media. A survey
analysis of 271 Facebook users shows that they do
get exposed to cross-cutting information frequently,
and that cross-cutting information was more likely
to come from weak ties, or acquaintances and

strangers in their network, as opposed to strong ties
of friends and families. Furthermore, those who
have ethnically and _ religiously more diverse
networks were more likely to be exposed to cross-
cutting information. Taken together, it is argued
that individuals’ network characteristics, such as
network compositions and cultural diversity, can
influence the degree of the filter bubble.

ost news consumption these days migrated to the online sphere,

especially social media. Research indicates that 81% of Americans get at

least some of their news through websites, apps, or social media

(Mitchell et al., 2016), and the majority of American users of Facebook,

Twitter, and Reddit say they get news from those platforms (Gottfried &

Shearer, 2016). Amid such transitions in the media environment, news is becoming

increasingly “algorithmically driven” such that computerized algorithms determine what

news contents users are exposed to. This results in a grave societal concern, because the

public may become trapped in the so-called “filter bubble,” in which they are protected
from new, challenging, and stimulating viewpoints. The filter bubble or echo chamber
effects (Sunstein, 2003; 2017) threaten a healthy functioning of democracy, because, the
argument goes, the personalized Internet and social media make it difficult for users to
see the other side of arguments: When people are stuck in an ideological silo of like-
minded people, it provides a fertile ground where disinformation and extreme political
polarization can easily occur.

While it is a valid threat to democracy and the public sphere, the concept of the
filter bubble or echo chambers requires more theoretical sophistication and empirical
support. In particular, popular claims publicizing the negative effects mostly remain at
anecdotal case studies (e.g., Pariser, 2011). This means that there is a need to investigate
those phenomena more systemically. This study probes the degree to which social media
users are exposed to disagreeable viewpoints by employing the idea of cross-cutting
exposure (Mutz, 2006). The overall argument and findings of the study are that while we
need to acknowledge some of the potential problems of filter bubbles, we need to critically
evaluate their extent and effects, because the digital public today, with their multiple and
overlapping identities and diverse networks, are keenly aware of different viewpoints
surrounding them, and that their media diet tend to include at least some disagreements
and challenging perspectives.

Following the crystallization framework (Wohn & Bowe, 2014), which states that
people’s online social network will act as agenda setters, this study conceptualizes social
media as not just a platform of news delivery but socially embedded experience that has
influence on individuals’ understanding of the world. While the idea of the filter bubble
focuses on the power of computer algorithms, this study emphasizes the importance of
people in their social media networks. That is, the degree to which people are confined to
like-minded opinions is dependent on many factors including the makeup of one’s social
media network. For example, those who have many weak ties in their network — strangers
and acquaintances — are less likely to be trapped in the silo of like-minded viewpoints.
Thus, while the filter bubble may still exist, the power of the computer algorithms is

countered by the networks that individuals choose to connect with online.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Exposure to Disagreement in the Algorithmic Age

It has been well known in social science research that people tend to selectively
expose themselves to the information and viewpoints they agree with. While selective
exposure or homophily has been around as long as humans have existed, it is the
supposedly unprecedented degree in the age of the Internet and social media that worries
many. Pariser (2011), who coined the term filter bubble, argues that today’s massive
filtering algorithms present threat to our information diet. He shows an example in which
the same search term “BP” prioritizes investment information of the firm to a certain user
and the oil spill disaster information to another. Pariser argues that this filtering closes
users off to new ideas and counter viewpoints. The filter bubble may eventually
undermine civic discourse and make people vulnerable to propaganda and manipulation
by advertisers and politicians, according to Pariser. In a similar vein, Sunstein’s (2003;
2017) echo chamber thesis suggests users in today’s Internet are trapped in a chamber in
which they listen to only similar voices and this is driving political fragmentation,
polarization, and extremism. In his latest book, Sunstein (2017) especially focuses on the
negative role of social media in people’s news diet, saying its extreme customization
creates "cybercascades,” and "polarization entrepreneurism," which endangers the shared
conversations, understandings, and experiences. It is in this context that some media
outlets suggested the proliferation of the filter bubble and fake news even swayed the
2016 U.S. presidential election in favor of Donald Trump (Parkinson, 2016; Read, 2016).

While it is no doubt that the filter bubble or echo chambers are a valid concern that
may threaten healthy civic discourse, the ideas are conceptually not clear and their
empirical support is rather limited. In fact, latest academic research documents the
opposite, showing that people are more likely to be outside the bubble or echo chambers
using the Internet or social media than offline, because of the diverse online social
structure and personal relationships (See for examples, Bakshy et al., 2015; Barnidge,
2017; Gentzkow & Shapiro, 2011). Theoretically, it would also stand to reason to think
that the digital media universe today is actually helpful in breaking the bubble, when
compared to the offline world: We are less likely to encounter discussion partners who

have different viewpoints from ours in offline, because such face-to-face encounter is very

24 | Spring 2020

uncomfortable. But in online, especially in social media, there exists norms of self-
expression, and with the help of more anonymity and less social presence, differing
viewpoints can be further facilitated (Barnidge, 2017). There is evidence that the existence
of social endorsement on social media, such as peer recommendations, mitigates partisan
selective exposure, because social endorsements shift attention away from partisan source
cues (Messing & Westwood, 2014). Furthermore, many people online select information
not necessarily on purpose perusing partisan cues, but on whims while browsing. Doing so,
they get exposed to disagreeing viewpoints while they seek news that is interesting, fun,
and socially relevant. In other words, there is a higher chance of “incidental exposure” to
disagreeable viewpoints on social media than offline (Kim, Chen, & de Zuniga, 2013;
Tewksbury et al., 2001).

That's why a well-known large-scale study of Facebook found that exposure to
disagreement is not uncommon: Bakshy and colleagues (2015) showed that for every four
Facebook friends that share same political ideology, users have at least one friend with
contrasting views. Other recent studies that looked at news personalization found no
discernable effects of the filter bubble or echo chambers (Flaxman et al., 2016; Haim et al.,
2018). Some studies further suggest that social media use is actually helpful in breaking
the filter bubble: A study by Beam and colleagues (Beam, Child, Hutchens, & Hmielowski,
2018) found that on the social media, “context collapse” occurs as users have to imagine
and negotiate interacting with a large and diverse audience, and that this context collapse
leads to more sharing and discussing news with people of diverse backgrounds in the
users’ lives. Another study by the authors (Beam, Hutchens, & Hmielowski, 2018) found
that Facebook news use in the long run leads to depolarization of partisan attitudes
among the users.

At the very minimum, it can be argued that online media users, while seeking
information that conforms to their pre-existing perspectives, do not necessarily actively
avoid counter-attitudinal information, as suggested by Garrett's (2009) research. That is,
people use the control afforded by online information sources to increase their exposure to
like-minded opinions, without sacrificing contact with other opinions.

The ideas of the filter bubble and echo chambers posited by the popular narratives

of Pariser and Sunstein are rather simplistic in that they assume a passive media user

Underneath the Filter Bubble

trapped by a loop of similar informational flow: The audience here are considered to be
incapable of navigating the diverse world, because they are trapped in their own
ideological silo. But in today’s digital world, a person usually has multiple and overlapping
identities and belongs to fragmented, yet multiple publics. You are a veteran, gay, father,
and consumer activist at the same time, for example. This idea is also supported by
empirical research. Graellis-Garrido and colleagues (2014) suggest that among people of
opposing views, there exists common interests, which may work as an intermediary topic
that connect them, thereby increasing diversity in exposure.

The Power of Network Compositions and Diversity

As suggested so far, the concern about the filter bubble or echo chambers is rather
overblown. But this does not mean that they do not exist, nor are they a healthy
phenomenon. Exposure to diverse viewpoints and civil discussions around them are
certainly an important democratic value, and, we should strive to remove any potential
roadblocks against such a noble cause. However, much like the fuss surrounding the filter
bubble, many attempts to break it seem to be problematic as well. Pariser (2011), for
example, suggests Google or Facebook place a slider bar running from “only stuff I like” to
“stuff other people like that I will probably hate” at the top of search results and the
newsfeed to fight the filter bubble. Others developed the so-called “serendipity” web
browsers that encourage users to see disagreeable news and counter viewpoints. Such
efforts are noble. However, they are artificial and forced efforts and their effectiveness is
questionable. Many of those initiatives are thus short-lived.

This paper argues what matters more in breaking the filter bubble is a diverse
network of people in the digital universe that is naturally occurring. Many classical
studies in communication and psychology (e.g., Katz & Lazarsfeld, 1955) suggest that it is
personal influence rather than media that is far more influential. More recent research
documents the positive impact of heterogeneous social networks that include increased
news use, political discussion, and democratic citizenship (Kim, Hsu, & de Zuniga, 2013;
Scheufele et al., 2006). In particular, weak ties, or a loose coalition of acquaintances,
strangers, and distant friends may play a crucial role in encouraging exposure to diverse
viewpoints. In the so-called “strength of weak ties,” Granovetter (1973) showed that weak

ties are critical for the exposure to novel information and political mobilization. While

26 | Spring 2020
Min & Wohn

communication occurring among strong ties usually employ “restricted codes,” or an
implicit mode of talk that shares a same culture or background, communication among
weak ties often requires much more explicit elaboration to achieve more meaningful
exchange. That elaboration and openness are often beneficial to new ideas and
innovations. This theory of weak ties fits the bill very well in today’s connected digital
media world where people get informed and mobilized based on specific issues to form an
“issue public” or become a “monitorial citizen” (Schudson, 1998; Shirky, 2008). The social
media platforms allow individuals to maintain a vast array of online relationship
composed of both strong and weak ties (Hampton et al., 2009), which includes workplace
relationships, a fertile ground for cross-cutting exposure (Mutz & Mondak, 2006). An
enlarged network of people, after all, increases the possibility of exposure to diverse
viewpoints in a natural manner. If we want to address the filter bubble and political
polarization, we should care about connecting people, not forcefully providing more
counter information.

This network effect, rather than a medium effect, is the essence of the
crystallization framework (Wohn & Bowe, 2014; 2016). In this framework, the term
crystallization is used to describe how people’s perception of reality is formed in the age of
social media. It is most likely the people in the network, rather than mass media, will act
as both first and second-level agenda setters, determining what information users are
exposed to and even influence how people will interpret this information. Since most social
media contents are created, curated, and engaged by users, the contents that individuals
see in their feeds come from the contents that their networks post. The contents they see
are not “news on social media,” but “news from one’s social network via social media”
(Wohn et al., 2017). This way, the crystallization framework emphasizes the importance of
people’s networks, which is absent in the current discussion of filter bubble or echo
chamber effects.

Since people have different network compositions, the uniform sense of reality that
may have existed in past mass media times may not be present in an era where most news
comes through social media. The empirical research from the crystallization framework
found the importance of network compositions in social media. For example, having a

diverse cultural network in terms of ethnicity and religion influences the users’ exposure

The Journal of Social Media in Society, Vol. 9, No. 1
Underneath the Filter Bubble

and attitudes toward such key social issues as #BlackLivesMatter (Wohn et al., 2017); In
another study, it was found that those who had primarily U.S. networks or U.S. military
networks, as opposed to non-US networks, were exposed to much cheering and triumph
over the news of the death of Osama bin Laden on their social media (Wohn & Bowe,
2014).

Research Questions and Hypotheses

The above section highlights how important network diversity can be, but the
concept of network diversity itself is multifaceted and complex. The concept of the filter
bubble or echo chambers is also rather vague and difficult to operationalize. The filter
bubble and echo chambers, at their root, share the basic idea of selective exposure. But
Pariser’s filter bubble mostly focuses on algorithmic and technological filters that limit
perspectives to like-minded information, whereas Sunstein’s echo chambers focus more on
the ideological segregation resulting from being surrounded by like-minded contacts and
ideas. In terms of operationalizating the ideas of filter bubbles or echo chambers, we
employ the “cross-cutting exposure,’ the degree to which individuals are exposed to
socially and politically disagreeable information. This construct is one the most well-
known and robust measures to gauge the degree of one’s exposure to counter-attitudinal
information. Cross-cutting exposure has been widely used and studied in the social
sciences (e.g., Min & Wohn, 2018; Mutz 2006; Mutz & Mondak, 2006).

In this study, we first attempt to see to what degree social media users are exposed
to cross-cutting information. Therefore,

RQ1. What is the overall extent of cross-cutting exposure to politically and socially

disagreeable news on social media?

In particular, we hypothesize that cross-cutting exposure will more likely come from
weak ties on social media. Weak ties are a loose connection of acquaintances and
strangers, and they can be a better facilitator of new information than strong ties such as
family members and close friends, as previous research suggested (Granovetter, 1973;
Shirky, 2008). Therefore,

H1. Cross-cutting exposure to politically and socially disagreeable news will more

likely come from weak ties than from strong ties.

The more weak ties an individual has, the more diverse his or her network will be.
Diversity is critical in facilitating cross-cutting exposure to disagreement. Homogeneous
networks of similar cultural backgrounds usually result in the sharing of similar thoughts
and discussions, whereas heterogenous networks will likely increase the possibility of
encountering differing viewpoints. Based on this rationale, the following hypotheses are
presented:

H2. Network cultural diversity will be positively associated with cross-cutting

exposure to politically and socially disagreeable information.

METHODS
Procedure and Sample

This study employed a nationwide survey of U.S. Facebook users to understand
their exposure to disagreeable information. Between October 6 and 10, 2016, a Qualtrics
web panel of 585 individuals took part in the survey and 271 finished it, yielding the
completion rate of 46.3%. Although it was a quota sample, not a random sample, it was
close to the general U.S. population in terms of various demographic measurements. While
there are concerns for using online opt-in panels, it is increasingly an accepted practice in
an era where random digit dialing to collect probability samples has become very difficult
and expensive. Indeed, evidence suggests that use of online opt-in panels makes little
difference in quality (Ansolabehere & Schaffner, 2014).

We limited the sample to Facebook users, because of the social media giant's
dominance in news distribution. We also created quotas for political orientation to
resemble the U.S. population demographics—thus Republicans and Democrats were even,
each making 40% of the sample, while 20% identified as Independents. The sample’s
average age was 40 years old and it was about 58% female. The racial makeup was about
76% White Caucasian, 11% Asian, 9% Black, and 7% Latino/a. The average network size,
or the number of friends, was 423, ranging from 0 to 5,000 GSD = 799).

Variables and Analysis

Cross-cutting exposure measured the degree to which respondents encountered

politically and socially disagreeable news on Facebook. It employed a two-step

measurement such that cross-cutting exposure was differentiated based on the sources of

The Journal of Social Media in Society, Vol. 9, No. 1
Underneath the Filter Bubble

exposure. The overall cross-cutting exposure from all different sources (/= 17.02, SD=
4.34) were then divided into two groups: Strong and weak ties. Strong ties included
romantic partners, friends, families, and relatives, whereas weak ties included strangers,
classmates and co-workers, and public figures. This distinction of strong vs. weak ties was
supported by factor analysis: A principal component analysis with varimax rotation
yielded two factors eigenvalues over 1. Romantic partners, family, and friends all
produced loadings of at least .64 onto the first factor (and no significant loadings onto the
second factor) and were subsequently labeled “strong ties.” Together, they explained 41.5%
of the variance. The second factor derived was labeled “weak ties,” onto which public
figures and strangers produced loadings of over .80, and together they explained 22.2% of
the variance. Initially, coworkers/classmates presented an issue because it loaded onto
both the strong ties (55) and weak ties (54) to substantial degrees. Theoretically, it makes
also sense that coworkers and classmates can belong to both strong and weak ties
simultaneously because these relationships usually can be intersectional, encompassing
one’s public and private lives. For a clear empirical and theoretical distinction, we decided
to drop the coworkers/classmates from analysis. Dropping classmates/coworkers also

improved the amount of variance explained in each of the two factors (See Table 1).

The key independent variable was network cultural diversity, which is a composite
index of ethnic and religious diversities. Ethnic diversity and religious diversities were
measured by the popular Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, a widely accepted measure of
diversity used by ecologists, linguists, economists, sociologists, and demographers (Pew

Research Center, 2014). Also known as the Simpson’s D, the Herfindahl-Hirschman index

Min & Wohn
has been utilized in communication research as well (e.g., Eveland & Hively, 2009;
McDonald & Dimmick, 2003; Vitak, 2012). To generate the index, each survey respondent
was asked to estimate the proportions of their friends’ ethnicities and religions in his or
her Facebook network. The proportions were then squared and summed, which made the
index range from zero to one. One meant complete homogeneity, meaning, for example,
someone's Facebook friends consisting of completely one ethnicity only. In this research,
the inverse of the index was used to make a number close to one denote higher diversity
and a number close to zero denote homogeneity. In mathematical terms, the diversity
index (DP) was calculated as the following:

Tm
D= 1) pi?

i=1

where p/is the proportion of friends within each ethnic/religious category. The ethnic
diversity and religious diversity indexes were calculated separately. However, they were
highly correlated (r= .64) and these two were summed up and their average was taken to
create the network cultural diversity variable (/= .45, SD = .22).

Other variables included in the regression analysis as controls were political
ideology (/= 3.87, SD= 1.72) on a 7-point scale, with 1 being extremely liberal and 7
being extremely conservative, political interest (A/= 3.07, SD= .83 on a 4-point scale),
network size, which is the number of Facebook friends (A/= 423, SD= 799). News media
use measured the frequency of radio, television, newspaper, website, and social media
news use (M= 17.20, SD= 3.61). Political knowledge was constructed based on 4-items
probing the respondents’ knowledge of current and political affairs (A7= 1.99, SD = .82).
Finally, for demographics, White Caucasians and males were coded as 1, respectively, and
all others as 0. Educational level (/edian = some college) and income level (Median =

$50,000 to $59,999) were used as ordinal variables.

RESULTS

First of all, it was found that the vast majority (87.1%) of the respondents answered
they get exposed to disagreement to a good degree (RQ1). In descriptive statistics, more
than half (53.5%) said they get politically or socially disagreeable information

“sometimes,” and 33.6% said they get exposed “often” to such information. Only 12.9% said

The Journal of Social Media in Society, Vol. 9, No. 1
Underneath the Filter Bubble

they “never” (1.8%) or “rarely” (11.1%) get exposed to disagreement on social media. At
least in the respondents’ subjective perceptions, cross-cutting exposure was prevalent.
Hypothesis 1 predicted that cross cutting exposure to disagreeable information will
more likely come from weak ties. A paired sample ¢-test showed that the cross-cutting
exposure score (//= 2.67) from weak ties was statistically significantly higher than the
one coming from strong ties (7= 2.38) (¢= 4.61, df= 270, p< .001). Hypothesis 1 was
supported. Hypothesis 2 predicted that higher network diversity will be associated with
higher cross-cutting exposure. This hypothesis was supported. As seen in Table 2, when
the dependent variable of cross-cutting exposure was regressed upon the independent
variables, the coefficient for network cultural diversity (b = 4.80, p < .001), along with
those for network size and news media use, statistically significantly predicted higher
cross-cutting exposure, meaning that the more diverse and the larger one’s network is,
and the more people use news media, the more likely they are exposed to disagreement.

DISCUSSION

When the idea of the filter bubble was first introduced, there was a heightened
sense of concern that the personalized Internet and social media harm democratic
discourse and governance. This rather dystopian view that the new media trap us in the
silo of selective exposure is being increasingly disputed by latest research (for examples,
see, Bakshy et al., 2015; Flaxman et al., 2016; Haim et al., 2018; Newman et al., 2017).
The present study adds to this growing body of evidence that the extent of the filter bubble
is not as great as imagined in the popular narrative.

This study also contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the filter bubble,
probing what exist beneath it: It was found that one’s network characteristics may
influence the degree of cross-cutting exposure to disagreement. Individuals still have
agency in terms of deciding whom to be connected with on social media, which directly
relates to the type of content they will see and ultimately engage with. Algorithms do not
choose whom one connects to online—this is a human choice. Thus, blaming technology
may be an oversight of the underlying problem. The findings do not dismiss, however, the
power of algorithms. Algorithms certainly play a part in the news one sees on social
media, because many social media systems use algorithms to curate the content users are
exposed to. Thus, there is of course the chance that even if one chooses to connect online
with a very diverse group of people, the algorithm could potentially filter out all the
information coming from those diverse networks.

Consistent with previous research (Granovetter, 1973; Shirky, 2008), weak ties are
found to play an important role in facilitating exposure to diverse information. With weak
ties that come without strong personal or emotional attachments, social media users may
experience more emotionally detached, casual, and incidental social interactions, which
creates opportunities for them to gather information, taste, and try out disagreement (Min
& Wohn, 2018). The importance of weak ties found in this research needs a cautious
interpretation, however. It should be noted that our study is among the few that probed
the role of weak ties in acquiring “political information.” Much of the original work on
information and weak ties was related to information about new jobs—the rationale was
that people who are similar have access to similar information, and thus weak ties were

more likely to be ones with information about jobs that close ties do not. However, when it

The Journal of Social Media in Society, Vol. 9, No. 1
Underneath the Filter Bubble

comes to news and politics, the information is much more complex. For example, a strong
tie is equally likely as a weak tie to have thoughts that are both agreeable and
disagreeable to an individual. Say, among close friends Steve and Alex, it could be the case
that Alex posts news about political views that Steve disagrees with, but they are still
close friends because of their shared interest in science fiction. This means that there is a
need to further investigate complex personal relationships present in social media
interactions. Future research should tease out these intricacies.

Another issue with this study is that the factor analysis found
coworkers/classmates, often regarded as an example of weak ties where frequent cross-
cutting exposure takes place (Mutz & Mondak 2006), belonged to both strong and weak
ties. Why this happened is unclear. But we speculate that while Mutz and Mondak
imagined the workplace as an archetypical place of a weak tie and cross-cutting exposure
in the offline world only, the colleagues and classmates in our study represented
relationships taking place both in the offline and social media world. As suggested earlier,
the private/public relationship can be easily blurred on social media and that is perhaps
why coworkers/classmates loaded onto both the strong ties and weak ties factors. Future
research should focus on the changing nature of coworker/classmate relationships in the
age of social media.

As typical in survey research, the cross-cutting exposure and the cultural network
diversity indexes used in this study were self-perception measures, which suggest they
may not accurately reflect the actual amount of cross-cutting exposure or actual diversity
in individuals’ social networks. However, many studies probing network characteristics
routinely use self-report measures (e.g., Choi & Lee, 2015; Lee et al., 2014; Scheufele et al.
2004; 2006). Furthermore, it can be argued that self-perception of disagreement is deemed
a better measurement of cross-cutting exposure than a third-party’s judgment of
incongruence, because, after all, if individuals do not perceive that disagreement has
occurred, it will have less of an effect on their attitudes and behavior (Barnidge, 2017).
For diversity, it was shown that a subjective measure of diversity is correlated with an
objective diversity measure, rendering some support to the use of a self-report measure

(Mislevy, 2009).

Cross-cutting exposure to disagreement is normatively a very important concept.
Being exposed to diverse viewpoints and experiencing challenging opinions is a bedrock of
modern democracy. That’s why scholars are concerned about the filter bubble or echo
chambers: The more filter bubble or echo chambers we have, the less healthy our
democratic discourse will be. That basic premise is a valid idea. But we need more
thorough investigation of their concepts and operation. We need better understanding of
what exist underneath the filter bubble and what the specific dimensions of echo
chambers are, before jumping to the conclusion that they are hurting the public sphere
and democracy. We don’t know the true extent of the filter bubble, and, even if we
acknowledge its existence, we know very little about how people behave within that
bubble. There are many different ways people read, process, and engage with information,
and thus it’s difficult to conclude that the existence of the bubble will automatically leads
to negative outcomes.

As an effort to have a more contexualized understanding of the phenomenon, our
research found that there exist important roles of network characteristics — composition of
people in the social media network — that facilitates the exposure to disagreement, which
may mitigate the concerns of filter bubble effects. Therefore, in light of current research,
we argue that the best way to fight the filter bubble — if it exists — is naturally occurring
networks of diverse connections, especially weak ties. As argued before, users have the
agency to decide whom they connect with, and their conscious awareness to broaden their

network is an important asset required in the social media age.
