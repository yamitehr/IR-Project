Abstract

Although collective efforts are essential to fight COVID-19, public opinion in the
United States is sharply divided by partisan attitudes and health beliefs. Addressing the
concern that media use facilitates polarization, this study investigated whether social
and traditional media use for COVID-19 information attenuates or reinforces existing
disparities. This article focuses on two important areas where the public is highly
polarized: partisan affect and vaccine attitudes. Contradicting the filter bubble claim,
our survey (n= 1106) revealed that social media use made people less polarized in both
partisan affect and vaccine hesitancy. In contrast, traditional media use made people
more polarized in partisan affect. These findings corroborate the growing evidence that
social media provide diverse viewpoints and incidental learning.

Polarization has been a defining social concern in the United States and other countries
for the past several decades (Iyengar et al., 2019). Under the COVID-19 crisis, concerns
about polarization grow, noting that the pandemic is often politicized and thus exacer-
bates group conflicts as well as reinforces existing beliefs (Bird and Ritter, 2021; Green
et al., 2020; Hart et al., 2020). Given that a society’s ability to effectively respond to a
health crisis depends on citizens’ united minds and collective behavioral efforts (Kahan
et al., 2011), partisan conflicts and sharp divisions in health beliefs raise extra hurdles to
combat the pandemic (Pew Research Center, 2020a).

Some media scholars and social commentators have pointed out that emerging media
systems have accelerated opinion polarization, and such concerns are amplified during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Amid a rapidly changing novel crisis, people increasingly turn
to media outlets for up-to-date information (Dixon and Clarke, 2013). A recent study
found that individuals get information about COVID-19 from fragmented media sources
and such different media uses led to divergent perceptions and behaviors related to the
pandemic (Chung and Jones-Jang, 2021).

Among the diverse media sources, we have a particular interest in the role of social
media in polarization during the COVID-19 pandemic. The literature has presented con-
tinuous concerns about the link between social media use and polarization (Bakshy et al.,
2015; Pariser, 2011; Stroud, 2011). For instance, earlier research has suggested that
homogeneous networks or algorithmic decisions based on past online activities may cre-
ate filter bubbles or echo chambers where citizens’ existing attitudes tend to be rein-
forced without hearing the other side (Bennett and Iyengar, 2008; Pariser, 2011; Stroud,
2011). While these earlier concerns still stand during the COVID-19 pandemic where
politicized and unverified misinformation about health issues spreads among like-
minded networks, researchers began to call for a more nuanced approach. For example,
recent empirical evidence suggests that social media allow users to learn diverse view-
points through incidental exposure and that algorithm-driven filter bubble claims are
somewhat exaggerated (Bakshy et al., 2015; Beam et al., 2018; Lee and Xenos, 2022; Lu
and Lee, 2019; Nanz and Matthes, 2020; Weeks et al., 2017). Other studies also ques-
tioned the differential role of diverse social media platforms in contributing to polariza-
tion (e.g. Cinelli et al., 2020; Yarchi et al., 2021).

As such inconsistent views warrant further investigation in this line of research, the
current study aims to clarify whether social media use indeed amplifies polarization dur-
ing the COVID-19 pandemic. To set a comparison point for the role of social media use
in polarization, this study also examines the (de)polarizing role of traditional media.
Traditional media outlets such as TV, cable channels, radio, and newspapers may convey
more politically tinged, one-sided views than social media where at least some friends
and followers display diverse political spectrums. By exploring these two media plat-
forms, we can elucidate the unique role of different information sources. This article
addresses this matter in two contexts: affective partisan polarization and vaccine hesi-
tancy. Note that the former embraces more long-standing and abstract-level attitudes, but
the latter taps into more concrete and behavior-oriented attitudes that are constructed
responding to the specific social situation. By looking at two related but distinct-level
realms, we seek to provide increasing confidence in the interpretation of our reported
findings. In addition, two areas suffer from growing public divide. Defined as
Jones-Jang and Chung 3

 

the tendency of partisans to dislike, distrust, and discriminate against people from the
opposite party, affective partisan polarization poses a significant threat to collective pub-
lic health efforts, including the response to the COVID-19 (Druckman et al., 2020). At
the same time, citizens’ attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccines are also severely
divided (Grenier, 2020), presenting impending challenges to vaccination programs.

Using a national survey in the United States (1 =1106), this article contributes to the
literature in several aspects. First, we provide meaningful evidence that can speak to the
hotly debated topic—whether social media use adds more to the ongoing opinion polari-
zation. Second, this article distinguishes the roles of social media and traditional media
in polarization over the COVID-19 crisis. By investigating these two media separately,
we attribute our findings to the unique role of each media, not to the increasing exposure
to information about COVID-19 in general. Third, while prior studies have focused on a
single issue to examine polarization (Druckman et al., 2020; Hart et al., 2020), we aim to
increase confidence in the interpretation of our findings by presenting two analyses in
different domains, affective partisan polarization and vaccine attitudes, both of which
suffer from deepening public cleavage during COVID-19.

Literature review

Attitude reinforcement hypothesis versus counterclaims

As the digital media environment has increased the audience’s control and choice over
media content, selective exposure research has garnered enormous attention over the
past two decades. Some researchers declared a new era of minimal effects (Bennett and
Iyengar, 2008), indicating that selective media exposure to agreeable views will lead to
attitude reinforcement without producing sizable attitude change. Research indicates that
exposure to like-minded views reinforces existing attitudes, resulting in greater polariza-
tion (Dylko et al., 2018; Stroud, 2011). Concerns have suggested that such an imbal-
anced media diet harms deliberative democracy, facilitating lack of tolerance and open
minds at the individual level as well as polarization and fragmentation at the society level
(Bennett and Iyegnar, 2008; Shin, 2020; Stroud, 2011).

Analyzing large-scale Facebook digital trace data, Facebook researchers (Bakshy
et al., 2015) examined the extent to which users encounter attitude-consistent or counter-
attitudinal views. The study identified three mechanisms that facilitate selective expo-
sure, including individual choice, homogeneous networks, and algorithmic decisions.
However, there have been contrasting views regarding each mechanism; while many
scholars supported the attitude reinforcement hypothesis, other media researchers have
pushed back against the notion of echo chambers and filter bubbles, calling for a more
sophisticated approach to examine the role social media plays in terms of polarization.

The first point of debate is whether people make conscious choices for pro-attitu-
dinal content. Some studies suggest that individuals selectively choose attitude-con-
sistent content to avoid potential cognitive discomfort and to maintain self-esteem or
social identities Jang, 2014; Knobloch-Westerwick, 2012). The reinforcing spirals
model proposes that media effects and selection mutually influence each other and
create reinforcing spirals over time (Slater, 2015). The model suggests that the
4 new media & society 00(0)

 

reinforcing processes are notably accelerated in the presence of social change, con-
flict, and salient identity cues.

However, other studies argued that users do not always avoid counter-attitudinal
information (e.g. Garrett et al., 2013). Evidence also suggests that the selection of media
content is determined by many other factors besides the similarity between users’ exist-
ing views and media content. Survey data from 12 countries show that digital informa-
tion consumption is not primarily driven by ideological consistency but by other
historical, economic, and political factors (Fletcher et al., 2020). In a similar vein, users
obtaining news from Facebook were more likely to be exposed to both pro- and counter-
attitudinal information, eventually resulting in decreased polarization (Beam et al.,
2018). Moreover, other content features such as social metrics (i.e. number of likes or
shares) or information utility are known to function as powerful cues that override ideo-
logical preferences (Chung, 2017; Messing and Westwood, 2014).

The next competing arguments are about whether people compose largely homogene-
ous networks on social media. Research found that the user network is the most powerful
driver limiting cross-cutting exposure (Bakshy et al., 2015). According to this study, the
likelihood of cross-cutting exposure on social media is substantially reduced from 45%
to 24% (liberals) and from 40% to 35% (conservatives) due to their homogeneous net-
works compared to random networks. Another line of research indicated that to maintain
popularity on social media, users tend to engage in politically safe discussions with like-
minded individuals (Miller et al., 2015).

However, a different line of research indicates that users in the current informa-
tion environment are afforded increasing opportunities to encounter diverse view-
points (Beam et al., 2018; Kobayashi, 2020; Lu and Lee, 2019). Studies found that
Facebook users do not typically choose friends based on their political similarity
(Kim and Lee, 2016), and at least 20% of users’ networks display opposite political
identities (Bakshy et al., 2015). Given that social media users often have hundreds
of friends online, it is hard to assume that their social networks fully consist of ideo-
logically homogeneous users.

Furthermore, other scholars posited that social media platforms are distinct in their
features/affordances and thus may facilitate or inhibit cross-cutting exposure to varying
degrees. For instance, Facebook may offer fewer opportunities for cross-cutting expo-
sure than other social media platforms given its heavy reliance on users’ self-curated
social networks and the algorithm that prioritizes congenial content (Nahon, 2016).
Proposing the “expression, news, and discussion (END)” model, Settle (2018) explained
how specific affordances of Facebook (e.g. political content presentation, identity main-
tenance design, social feedback) are associated with political polarization. In contrast, on
Twitter or YouTube, users can follow accounts without joining a community and interact
with users who are not in their network of friends and peers (Yarchi et al., 2021).

The third debated point is whether social media algorithms exclude counter-attitudinal
information. With the advent of social media, some researchers provide platform-driven
explanations for the mechanism of selective exposure. For example, a recent experiment
found that YouTube algorithms recommend videos that reinforce viewers’ existing politi-
cal opinion (Cho et al., 2020). This approach stresses the role of social and algorithmic
filters through which social media curates information to users. Overall, this approach
Jones-Jang and Chung 5

 

views the current media environment as fostering polarization by creating a filter bubble
where people live in their own personalized world without having to interact with people
with different views (Pariser, 2011).

In contrast, other studies suggest that algorithms may present a broader range of per-
spectives as compared to when users actively select information (Bakshy et al., 2015).
This view highlights the possibility of incidental learning, whereby social media users
happen to be exposed to fresh or opposite ideas posted by other users or fed by algorith-
mic filters (Nelson and Webster, 2017; Yamamoto and Morey, 2019). Exposure to a
wider range of opinions is related to weaker attitudes or attitudinal ambivalence
(Hmielowski et al., 2017). The mechanism of incidental learning largely relies on social
media users’ passive information consumption. One report on social media use indicates
that users often obtain information not through active information-seeking but through
clicks while “doing other things” online (Gottfried and Shearer, 2016). Similarly,
researchers suggest that the multitasking nature of online behavior fosters passive infor-
mation consumption. Evidence shows that multitaskers do not have sufficient cognitive
resources to selectively seek out attitude-consistent information and avoid attitude-
challenging information (Jang, 2014).

Affective partisan polarization

Affective partisan polarization, commonly referred to as hostility toward political out-
groups, 1s conceptually rooted in social identity theory. The theory posits that individuals
consider themselves representative members of broad social, cultural, and political
groups (Tajfel et al., 1979). Party identification, typically categorized as Democrat or
Republican in the United States, has functioned as a key group identity associated with a
host of attitudinal and behavioral consequences (Iyengar et al., 2019; Mason, 2018).
When citizens identify with a party, they automatically categorize people, values, and
ideas into us (in-group) against them (out-group), accompanied by positive or negative
feelings. Affective partisan polarization is commonly conceptualized and operational-
ized as the gap between positive feelings toward individuals’ preferred parties and nega-
tive feelings toward their opposing party (Druckman et al., 2020). Before our primary
investigation regarding the role of the media, we hypothesize that the degree of affective
partisan polarization depends on individuals’ political identities. Thus, this study antici-
pates that those with stronger liberal (conservative) views are more likely to exhibit
stronger favoritism toward Democrats (Republicans) and hostility toward Republicans
(Democrats).

H1: Political identities will lead to in-group and out-group partisan bias (affective
polarization).

Although antagonism between the two political groups in the United States is nothing
new, concerns have mounted that affective polarization worsened during the COVID-19
pandemic (Druckman et al., 2020; Iyengar et al., 2019). Prior research showed that when
feeling threatened by emerging rival ideologies or conflicting external events, partisans
6 new media & society 00(0)

 

tend to consolidate their collective identity through selective exposure (Esses et al.,
2002; Slater, 2015). Some scholars assert that social media in particular have become a
battleground for such partisan echo chambers during this pandemic (Uscinski et al.,
2020). For example, a series of conspiracy theories such as COVID-19 being a ploy to
defeat Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election or to control society have been
widely circulated among conservative social media users. In such a setting, social media
use may reinforce existing partisan sentiment and thus amplify hostility toward political
opponents.

However, other scholars argue that greater use of social media is not necessarily
associated with faster growth in partisan polarization. For instance, Boxell et al.
(2017) found a greater increase in polarization among the groups who are less likely
to use social media (e.g. older than 65), implying a limited role of social media in
explaining political polarization. Furthermore, a recent experimental study found that
social information exchange in an egalitarian network makes partisans /ess polarized
(Becker et al., 2019). The finding suggests that in an egalitarian social network where
new ideas and opinions can emerge from anyone in the group, partisans tend to adopt
a moderate opinion. Other research also showed that users relying on Facebook for
news tended to be exposed to cross-cutting views and show less extreme views (Beam
et al., 2018). Here, social media provide users with opportunities for incidental learn-
ing (Nelson and Webster, 2017).

In this light, we focus on the moderating role of social media use in affective polariza-
tion by investigating whether the proposed relationship in H1 between political identities
and affective polarization becomes strengthened or weakened as social media use
increases. As the literature provides strong theoretical reasonings for both arguments, we
present two competing hypotheses as H2a and H2b.

H2a: Social media use for COVID-19 information will reinforce the relationship
between political identities and affective partisan polarization (H1).

H2b: Social media use for COVID-19 information will weaken the relationship
between political identities and affective partisan polarization (H1).

To set a comparison point for the role of social media use in affective polarization, this
study also examines the (de)polarizing role of traditional media. Without examining the
role of traditional media, it is difficult to disentangle whether social media use or the
quantity of information about COVID-19 is the factor that facilitates affective
polarization.

Some argue that traditional media would not trigger affective polarization because the
content selection and publication would show a less partisan slant due to the journalistic
norm of objectivity (Harcup and O’Neill, 2017; Phillips, 2015). However, others claim
that such journalistic values are less pronounced in the current media landscape where
partisan content is known to attract a larger audience (Hamilton, 2004). A recent study
found that conservative media reported numerous rumors and conspiracy theories about
COVID-19 in an attempt to underestimate the pandemic and undermine efforts to prop-
erly address the risk (Jamieson and Albarracin, 2020). As these contrasting views about
Jones-Jang and Chung 7

 

the role of traditional media have relatively insufficient theoretical frameworks, we ask
the following research question:

RQI1: Does traditional media use for COVID-19 information strengthen or weaken
the relationship between political identities and affective polarization?

Divides in vaccine attitudes

Citizens’ attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccines have been severely polarized, with
growing divisions between those who long for the vaccines and those who do not
(Grenier, 2020). What mainly drives such divides is antivaccine sentiments that have
been around since the UK doctor Andrew Wakefield proposed links between MMR
(measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccinations and autism in the 1990s. Extending their
existing distrust in MMR vaccines, anti-vaxxers have promulgated various rumors and
conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccines (Wallis, 2020). False claims such as
COVID-19 vaccination being used to implant a microchip to track people or that RNA-
based vaccines will alter a recipient’s DNA are just a few examples. Antivaccine senti-
ments could have lethal consequences, as the efficacy of the vaccine is contingent on
widespread and timely vaccination.

As in the case of affective polarization, we aim to examine how divided vaccine atti-
tudes are reinforced or weakened depending on the use of social and traditional media.
To do so, we need to establish a reasonable cognitive link as a baseline relationship in the
vaccine context. While there could be a variety of factors contributing to vaccine atti-
tudes, a central tenet of antivaccine sentiments has long been a misguided belief that
MMR vaccinations cause autism (Salmon et al., 2015; Smith and Graham, 2019). Thus,
we decided to use the cognitive link between prior misguided vaccine beliefs and cur-
rent/future vaccine hesitancy as a target relationship.

One thing to note is that we did not make the link specifically about COVID-19 (e.g.
misbeliefs about COVID-19 vaccines) for a reason. Although numerous false claims
about COVID-19 vaccines have emerged, most of them remain as mere misinformation
or rumors. There has been no empirical evidence that misbeliefs about COVID-19 vac-
cines shape vaccine hesitancy. Rather, scholars have indicated that a misguided belief
about MMR vaccinations and autism has served as one of the most visible causes of
vaccine hesitancy (McKeever et al., 2016; Salmon et al., 2015; Smith and Graham,
2019). Taken together, we expect that those who hold stronger misbeliefs about the link
between vaccines and autism are more likely to show vaccine hesitancy in general. This
cognitive link will serve as a baseline relationship that is either strengthened or weak-
ened through media use during the pandemic.

H3: Misbeliefs about the link between vaccines and autism lead to vaccine
hesitancy.

Supposing that existing vaccine misbeliefs are an important factor in predicting
COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (Reynolds, 2020), two opposite predictions can emerge
8 new media & society 00(0)

 

concerning how people’s attitudes toward vaccines change when confronting the circum-
stances of the pandemic. On the one hand, the unprecedented timescale of vaccine devel-
opment and production may further fuel vaccine hesitancy among those who already
hold mistrust in vaccines. Anti-vaxxers assert that a rushed vaccine would be improperly
tested and thus have safety issues (Riviére, 2020). On the other hand, as public fear has
grown with increasing death tolls of COVID-19 and vaccines have been eagerly antici-
pated as the most effective way to end the pandemic, those who once rejected vaccines
may reconsider their stance (Reynolds, 2020).

Admitting these two possible scenarios, we focus on how social and traditional media
play different roles in the processes. Vaccine opponents have an outsized presence on social
media (Jang et al., 2019; Smith and Graham, 2019) and actively spread fears about COVID-
19 vaccines. For example, soon after the approval of Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 vac-
cine in the United Kingdom, anti-vaxxers on social media paralleled the vaccine to
thalidomide, which resulted in thousands of birth defects in the 1960s (Dupuy, 2020). Such
antivaccine arguments can be amplified by bots and state-sponsored trolls (Broniatowski
etal., 2018). This may place vaccine opponents in an echo chamber, leading them to believe
ina false consensus and reinforcing their pre-existing vaccine attitudes.

However, another notable trend is the movement of provaccine counterparts on social
media. For example, on Twitter, many people are putting energy into debunking or refut-
ing antivaccine claims (Burki, 2020), if not directly promoting COVID-19 vaccines.
These actions are distinguishable from previous vaccine debates in which vaccine propo-
nents were not visible on social media (McKeever et al., 2016). The balance between
antivaccine and provaccine information on social media may help anti-vaxxers correct
their misunderstanding about the vaccine and be less concerned about it. As in the con-
text of affective partisan polarization, contrasting views about the role of social media
show strong theoretical claims. Hence, we present two competing hypotheses.

H4a: Social media use for COVID-19 information will reinforce the relationship
between misguided vaccine beliefs and vaccine hesitancy (H3).

H4b: Social media use for COVID-19 information will weaken the relationship
between misguided vaccine beliefs and vaccine hesitancy (H3).

There could be similar contrasting expectations for the role of traditional media. On
the one hand, media coverage of COVID-19 vaccines may not be particularly polarized
given the important role of the vaccine in ending the pandemic. For instance, although
antivaccine sentiments are often associated with conservative stances (Jamison et al.,
2020), major conservative media covered leading Republican figures’ (e.g. Mike Pence)
COVID-19 vaccination, which was aimed to boost public confidence in the safety of
vaccines. On the other hand, conservative media have consistently created doubts about
the vaccine and frequently spotlighted isolated adverse reactions to the vaccine without
much context (Darcy, 2020). In this light, we propose the following research question:

RQ2: Does traditional media use for COVID-19 information strengthen or weaken
the relationship between misguided vaccine beliefs and vaccine hesitancy?

Method

Participants

This study relied on a national survey conducted in the United States. A total of 1106
online panels from the research company Dynata participated in the survey. Using the
stratified quota, this study sample mirrors the US population as reported by the 2017
American Community Survey (ACS; American Community Survey, 2017). The median
age was 44.4 in this study and 46.7 in the 2017 ACS. Our sample included 52.9% female
participants, while 51.4% of the ACS sample was female. The median income category
in this study was US$50,000-US$74,999, and the 2017 ACS reported US$57,652 as the
median income. The median education level in our study was “2-year college degree
including current students,” which was similar to the “some college, no degree” in the
ACS survey.

Although the debate about nonprobability national sampling is still underway, the
literature indicates that survey results are largely identical in nonprobability panel data
and representative population samples (for a review of the validity of online panels, see
Callegaro et al., 2014). The respondents were asked to complete an online questionnaire
to measure their media use for COVID-19 information, in-group/out-group affect, politi-
cal identities, vaccine beliefs, vaccine hesitancy, and demographic information. The sur-
vey and sampling procedure was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
researcher’s institute.

Measures

Affective polarization. We used an established measure of affective polarization, which
was calculated as the difference between the feeling thermometer scales for Republicans
and Democrats (see Haddock et al., 1993). Respondents were asked to rate their overall
feelings toward Republicans and Democrats on a scale ranging from 0 to 100. We then
subtracted the thermometer score for Republicans from that for Democrats (Af=6.30,
SD=56.40, range=—100 to 100). It should be noted that high levels of polarization
should be represented by the values close to —100 and close to 100, whereas values
around 0 should indicate low levels of polarization.

Political identities. Political identities were assessed on a 7-point scale ranging from
1=Fery conservative, 7 = Very liberal, M=3.78, SD=1.74).

Vaccine hesitancy. We measured vaccine hesitancy through two Likert-type scale items:
“T am concerned about serious adverse effects about vaccines,” “I intend to receive any
vaccination that my health care provider recommends in the future” (reverse coded;
1=Strongly disagree, 5=Strongly agree; M=2.60, SD=1.17, r=.65).

Misguided vaccine beliefs. We measured respondents’ pre-existing vaccine beliefs about
vaccine and autism using two items adapted from the literature (Jones-Jang and Noland,
2022). As most anti-vaxxers before the COVID-19 pandemic have focused on child vac-
cine risks related to autism, we assessed respondents’ perceived vaccine risks about
10 new media & society 00(0)

 

autism (Salmon et al., 2015) “Vaccines can cause autism” and “Vaccines can increase the
risk of developing autism” (1 =Strongly disagree, 5 = Strongly agree; M=2.21,SD=1.21,
r=.84).

Social media use. Respondents were asked, “How often have you used social media (e.g.
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube) to get information about Coronavirus?”
(1=Never, 5= Very often; M=2.75, SD=1.52). We also measured the use of individual
social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube) separately and ran
analyses with them. Since the results of our moderation analyses were almost identical
across platforms, we did not include individual results in this article.

Traditional media use for COVID-19. Respondents were asked, “How often have you used
national TV, radio, and/or newspapers to get information about Coronavirus?” (1 =Never,
5=Very often; M=3.43, SD=1.36).

Results

Analytic approach

This study employed a bootstrapping approach with the PROCESS macro for our pri-
mary investigations (Hayes, 2017). As we tested the model with two moderating varia-
bles, we employed Model 2 for our moderation analyses. As our investigation tapped
into two domains, we ran separate analyses for each. Political identity and vaccine beliefs
were entered as independent variables, and affective polarization and vaccine hesitancy
were entered as outcome variables. Media use variables (1.e. social media and traditional
media use for COVID-19 information) were included as two moderators. We are particu-
larly interested in whether the slope of existing links (e.g. relationship between political
identity and affective polarization) becomes steeper or flattened among heavy social/
traditional media users. Steeper slopes indicate the reinforcement of existing cognitive
links, and flattened slopes indicate moderated cognitive links. The analysis controlled for
age, gender, education, household income (for all hypotheses and RQs), and political
identities (only for H3, H4a-b, and RQ2).

Hypothesis tests

This study first hypothesized that individuals show affective polarization based on their
political identities (H1). That is, those with stronger liberal (conservative) views are
more likely to exhibit stronger favoritism toward Democrats (Republicans) and hostility
toward Republicans (Democrats). We then examine whether these partisan biases are
strengthened or weakened through social media and traditional media use for COVID-19
information (H2a, H2b, and RQ1). We also hypothesized that individuals’ existing mis-
guided vaccine beliefs predict their vaccine hesitancy (H3) and explored whether social
media and traditional media uses reinforce or weaken the link (H4a, H4b, and RQ2). The
results are summarized in Table 1.

The dependent variable (affective polarization) was calculated by the difference of feeling thermometers
(subtraction of Republicans from Democrats). Thus, higher scores in DV indicate a greater amount of favor-
itism of Democrats over Republicans. SE: standard error.

Confirming our expectation (H1), the results show that individuals show strong affec-
tive polarization based on their political identities after controlling for age, gender, edu-
cation, and household income. In a nutshell, the stronger individuals’ political identities,
the greater their in-group/out-group affect differences (i.e. affective polarization,
b=22.57, SE=2.27, p< .001). Next, in addressing the polarizing or depolarizing role of
media use on COVID-19, we investigated the statistical significance of two interaction
terms, political identities < social media use and political identities < traditional media
use. The results indicate that both interaction terms were significant but in opposite
directions. Supporting H2b but rejecting H2a, social media use for the COVID-19 weak-
ens the relationship between political identities and affective partisan polarization
(b=-3.37, SE=0.51, p <.001). Figure 1 on the left illustrates this pattern, showing that
the slope is significantly steeper among light social media users than among heavy social
media users for COVID-19. In contrast, traditional media use amplifies the relationship
(b=1.62, SE=0.54, p=.003). As seen in Figure | on the right, heavy traditional media
users display more affective partisan polarization based on their political identities than
light traditional media users.

We found similar results for the vaccine data. The results show that individuals
express vaccine hesitancy based on their pre-existing vaccine beliefs after controlling for
age, gender, education, household income, and political identities. The stronger one’s
belief in the link between vaccination and autism, the stronger one’s resistance to vac-
cines (b=.61, SE=.07, p<.001). Thus, H3 was supported. In exploring the moderating
role of social media (H4a and H4b), the results suggest that the interaction term of vac-
cine belief and social media is significant (6=~—.03, SE=.02, p=.04), which supported

Discussion

In light of heightened concern that social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic is
further sharpening public division (Druckman et al., 2020; Hart et al., 2020; Pew
Research Center, 2020a), this study examined whether social media use is associated
with the polarization process by strengthening individuals’ existing cognitive links. We
Jones-Jang and Chung 13

 

also examined the role of traditional media in making it comparable to the role of social
media.

We used two existing cognitive links as baseline tendencies that could be related to
media use. The first link indicates the well-known political tendency that individuals
discriminate against outgroups based on their political identities (affective partisan
polarization). Another link is that individuals with misguided beliefs about the effect of
MMR vaccines on autism are more likely to show vaccine hesitancy. While these two
links represent baseline tendencies based on pre-existing beliefs, the domains have prac-
tical importance. The public divide in the two domains can significantly harm efforts
against the current pandemic.

We then examined the moderating role of social media in these relationships. Contrary
to prior claims that social media should be blamed for polarization in society (Pariser,
2011; Stroud, 2011), our results show that the link between political identities and affec-
tive partisan polarization weakens as social media use for COVID-19 information
increases. Similarly, the link between misguided beliefs about child vaccines and vaccine
hesitancy weakens as social media use for COVID-19 information increases. These find-
ings highlight the positive aspect of social media use, supporting the claim that ideologi-
cal segregation on social media is “overestimated” (Barbera et al., 2015: 1531).

Although our survey data did not allow us to specify the mechanism through which
social media weaken the existing cognitive link, it is worth addressing possible mecha-
nisms for future research. The extant literature offers three possible explanations. First,
incidental exposure to diverse information on social media alleviates attitude reinforce-
ment and polarization in online communication (Lu and Lee, 2019; Nelson and Webster,
2017). Studies indicate that social media users come across news incidentally while
“online doing other things” (Gottfried and Shearer, 2016: 6). Recent research shows that
users report significant learning outcomes through incidental exposure to political news
(Nanz and Matthes, 2020). The findings suggest that once incidentally encountered
information is found to be relevant, users engage in effortful information processing.
Incidental exposure to unexpected information may thus have depolarizing outcomes.

Second, in deciding to click and learn information on social media, users may prior-
itize other information over the (mis)match between media content and users’ existing
beliefs. For example, research has shown that social media users rely more on social
cues, such as the number of likes and comments than the political affinity of information
(Chung, 2017; Messing and Westwood, 2014). In addition, other researchers theorize
that individuals are hardwired to pay attention to information that challenges rather than
supports their views when evaluating potential risk (Jang, 2014; Shoemaker, 1996).
Hence, individuals may be significantly attracted to new, unusual information in select-
ing information about COVID-19 or vaccines. Even when the new information conflicts
with their existing beliefs about ideologies or vaccines, individuals may seek wider
exposure out of a need to reassess the present danger.

Finally, it is likely that information presented by algorithms provides a wider range of
viewpoints than information actively selected by users (Bakshy et al., 2015). A large-
scale study using Facebook digital trace data concludes that like-minded exposure occurs
mostly due to users’ psychological orientation to avoid different views, but cross-cutting
exposure is widely available through algorithms (Bakshy et al., 2015). This study also
l4 new media & society 00(0)

 

suggests that users’ social networks are not as homogeneous as we think. Although our
findings cannot further explicate the underlying mechanism of how social media use
mitigates polarization, these possibilities deserve further investigation for a better under-
standing of the depolarizing effect of social media during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although our results in both the political and health domains consistently showed the
potential depolarizing role of social media, some may argue that this is not because peo-
ple get information about COVID-19 from social media, but because they receive more
information about COVID-19 regardless of the media platforms. To reject this possibil-
ity, we also examined the (de)polarizing role of traditional media. If the amount of infor-
mation matters, not the platforms, both social and traditional media uses regarding
COVID-19 should have shown the same directional pattern. However, we found oppo-
site roles in the two media. According to our analyses, social media weakened the cogni-
tive link in both domains, but traditional media either strengthened the link (in affective
partisan polarization) or had no impact (in vaccine hesitancy).

It is worth noting that the use of traditional media for COVID-19 information acceler-
ates affective partisan polarization. It is possible that traditional media users tend to be
frequent customers of specific partisan news outlets. As these partisan media outlets
increasingly convey politically tinged information and opinions, the habitual use of these
outlets may reinforce in-group favoritism and out-group hostility (Lelkes et al., 2017;
Stroud, 2011). In media use practice, social media users may encounter diverse views
more easily on one media platform, but it could be more difficult for traditional media
users to obtain information across multiple channels representing a wide range of politi-
cal spectrum.

Nevertheless, we did not find a polarizing role of traditional media in the context of
vaccine hesitancy. This nonfinding in the vaccine context may be attributed to the pos-
sibility that traditional media or even partisan sources do not promote consistent posi-
tions on vaccines. For example, while liberals in general tend to be more favorable
toward vaccination than conservatives, Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris questioned
vaccine safety during the presidential campaign (Kelly, 2020). As political elites and
partisan media do not signal crystallized, consistent opinions about vaccine issues, it
may be difficult to expect to see the significant role of traditional media one way or the
other.

This study offers important practical implications for combating the pandemic.
While the partisan division and polemic views on vaccines pose substantial obstacles
to efforts to end the pandemic, our findings suggest that social media may function as
an effective tool to mitigate such divisions (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[CDC], 2021; Pew Research Center, 2020a). The message to take away from this study
is thus positive, particularly given citizens’ increasing reliance on social media for
political and health information (Pew Research Center, 2016). Taking advantage of
this finding, governments, health organizations, and social media practitioners should
consider how their social media agendas (e.g. vaccination programs) can attract dis-
senters’ attention. As social media exposure typically occurs through spontaneous and
incidental clicking behaviors, it may be helpful to use social and recommendation cues
that increase the perceived credibility of the message (Chung, 2017; Messing and
Westwood, 2014).
Jones-Jang and Chung 15

 

Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, although the consistent results
of the social media’s depolarizing role in the two domains increase the generalizability
of the findings, it is still questionable whether the findings are generalizable to contexts
outside the United States. Some expressed concerns that the United States may be an
extreme case where media and public opinion are overly polarized (Bos et al., 2016;
Kubin and von Sikorski, 2021).

Second, although we review possible explanations of social media’s (de)polarizing
role, our survey data did not allow us to pinpoint specific working mechanisms.
Previously, Bakshy et al. (2015) who had access to Facebook big data reported that the
Facebook algorithm was not the primary factor of echo chamber. Similarly, Yarchi et al.’s
(2021) research looked at the degree of polarization across social media platforms and
unexpectedly found that Twitter showed a greater level of polarization than Facebook.
However, the study was not able to disentangle the primary causal mechanism of such
polarization as well. As it is challenging to distinctively measure incidental exposure and
exposure based on algorithms through self-reported data, future research using digital
trace data should examine this issue.

Third, although we believe that our findings illustrate important snapshots about the
(de)polarizing role of social media, the cross-sectional analysis does not allow us to rule
out the possibility of a reverse-direction influence such that the reinforcement of exist-
ing relationships (e.g. deepening affective partisan polarization) may decrease the moti-
vation to use social media. While we do not rule out this possibility, there has been little
research or theory to support this claim so far. On the contrary, arecent work (Osmundsen
et al., 2021), which analyzed both social media behavioral data and self-reported data,
concluded that partisan polarization (in the United States) was the primary psychologi-
cal motivation behind information sharing (both real and fake news) on social media.
Thus, although our data cannot directly demonstrate causal directions, our findings
combined with other literature may suggest that one way is more plausible than the
other way round. Future efforts should include long-term data to draw increasing causal
inferences.

Finally, we measured pre-existing vaccine beliefs related to autism as an anchor point
to test our second set of hypotheses, because most prior anti-vaccine movements have
been rooted in such misguided beliefs. However, some people, especially nonparents,
may possess misguided vaccine beliefs not based on child vaccines but from something
else. Future research should incorporate broader factors that shape vaccine beliefs.

Conclusion

While partisan polarization has reached high-level records (Pew Research Center, 2019),
there are concerns that media use and presentation of the COVID-19 pandemic may
aggravate polarization. Responding to this concern, this study examined the role of
media in strengthening or weakening existing cognitive links. The findings indicate that
social media do not aggravate but alleviate polarization in both contexts, including par-
tisan polarization and vaccine hesitancy. These are at odds with earlier filter bubbles or
echo chamber claims that social media exacerbate intergroup relations and attitude rein-
forcement (Pariser, 2011; Stroud, 2011). Given that social media outlets function as
16 new media & society 00(0)

 

important channels through which many people get information about COVID-19 (Pew
Research Center, 2020b) or future health crises, these findings offer some relief to those
concerned with increasing polarization surrounding public health issues. This study also
has practical implications: If managed well, social media could be an effective tool for
government or health organizations to reach a wide range of audiences for unbiased edu-
cation or communication during health crisis.
