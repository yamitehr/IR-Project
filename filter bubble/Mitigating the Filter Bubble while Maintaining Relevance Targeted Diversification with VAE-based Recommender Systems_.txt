ABSTRACT

Online recommendation systems are prone to create filter bubbles,
whereby users are only recommended content narrowly aligned
with their historical interests. In the case of media recommenda-
tion, this can reinforce political polarization by recommending
topical content (e.g., on the economy) at one extreme end of the
political spectrum even though this topic has broad coverage from
multiple political viewpoints that would provide a more balanced
and informed perspective for the user. Historically, Maximal Mar-
ginal Relevance (MMR) has been used to diversify result lists and
even mitigate filter bubbles, but suffers from three key drawbacks:
(1) MMR directly sacrifices relevance for diversity, (2) MMR typi-
cally diversifies across all content and not just targeted dimensions
(e.g., political polarization), and (3) MMR is inefficient in practice
due to the need to compute pairwise similarities between recom-
mended items. To simultaneously address these limitations, we
propose a novel methodology that trains Concept Activation Vec-
tors (CAVs) for targeted topical dimensions (e.g., political polariza-
tion). We then modulate the latent embeddings of user preferences
in a state-of-the-art VAE-based recommender system to diversify
along the targeted dimension while preserving topical relevance
across orthogonal dimensions. Our experiments show that our
Targeted Diversification VAE-based Collaborative Filtering (TD-
VAE-CF) methodology better preserves relevance of content to user
preferences across a range of diversification levels in comparison

1 INTRODUCTION

Online recommender systems are prone to create filter bubbles [4, 5,
14], where users are increasingly recommended content narrowly
aligned with their historical interests due to a feedback loop be-
tween data collection and recommendation processes [12]. While
the impacts of these recommendation feedback loops are some-
what nuanced (e.g., in some cases they can increase homogeneity
due to popularity bias in recommender systems [3, 6]), in the case
of media recommendation, it is observed that filter bubble effects
arising from feedback loops may restrict user perspectives and
viewpoints [1, 13]. As a case in point, we consider the row for VAE-
CF (a state-of-the-art recommender system [10]) in Figure 1, which
shows a Republican-shifted distribution of politically polarized Red-
dit community content recommendations (details in Section 3) for
a user that has historically consumed Republican-oriented content.

by projecting the item embeddings on the Concept Activation
Vector (CAV) aligned with the Republican-Democratic politi-
cal spectrum (Section 3). The recommendations for UUMMR
(Section 2) and TD-VAE-CF (Section 3) are computed using
3 different 1 diversity levels (0.2, 0.4, 0.8), where diversity
increases as A decreases. Unlike TD-VAE-CF, standard MMR
for diversification (U-MMR) is unable to improve diversity
(content balance) in the political spectrum.

However, considering that topical content of user interest such as
“the economy” may be represented in a variety of Reddit communi-
ties spanning the political spectrum, one might ask whether it is
possible to mitigate this filter bubble effect by shifting the political
coverage distribution to a more neutral or balanced position while
preserving recommendation relevance for the user?

Historically, Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) [2] (cf. Sec-
tion 2) has been used to diversify content rankings, including recent
methods aiming to mitigate filter bubble effects [11]. While such re-
sult list diversification may decrease quantitative metrics of recom-
mendation performance, user studies have shown that diversity can
also improve overall satisfaction with recommendation lists [20].
However, the drawback of post-hoc reranking methods like MMR
is their independent treatment of relevance and diversity [19] that

inherently trades off one for the other. Furthermore, MMR typically
diversifies across all content and not just targeted dimensions (e.g.,
political polarization). Finally, MMR’s post-hoc reranking approach
has quadratic time complexity in terms of the ranked list size.

In this paper, we propose a simple but empirically effective ap-
proach to address all of the aforementioned deficiencies of MMR.
Our Targeted Diversification VAE-CF (TD-VAE-CF) methodology
intrinsically dovetails with the latent user and item representations
in state-of-the-art VAE-based collaborative filtering (VAE-CF) [10].
Specifically, we train Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) [7] for
targeted diversification dimensions (e.g., political spectrum)
and use these to modulate latent embeddings of user preferences in
VAE-CF to diversify along that targeted dimension while preserving
topical relevance across orthogonal dimensions.

One can observe in Figure 1 that TD-VAE-CF clearly shifts the
political polarization distribution to a more neutral range as diversi-
fication strength increases (A decreases) in comparison to standard
untargeted MMR (U-MMR), which is unable to shift the political
spectrum; later we will see that a targeted version of MMR (T-MMR)
performs even worse. Furthermore, as evidenced in Figure 2, the
NDCG measure of recommendation relevance does not drop as
steeply for TD-VAE-CF as it does for U-MMR when diversification
strength is increased. We present more comprehensive experiments
in Section 4 that confirm these results in a variety of additional
settings, where we additionally show that the latent modulation
approach of TD-VAE-CF induces low computation overhead in
comparison to the quadratic time complexity of MMR.

In summary, TD-VAE-CF combines CAVs with VAE-based collab-
orative filtering to enable a novel targeted (e.g., political spectrum)
diversification approach for recommendation that efficiently and
selectively mitigates filter bubble effects while preserving relevance.

2 MAXIMAL MARGINAL RELEVANCE (MMR)

As one of the most popular ranked list diversification methods in the
literature and our baseline for comparison, we briefly review Maxi-
mal Marginal Relevance (MMR) [2] as it applies to the recommenda-
tion setting. Given a set I of items to select s; € F, we aim to build
an optimal subset of items Sh c £ (where Isp =kandk < |£]) rel-
evant to a given user wu. For computational efficiency, we will build
Sj in a greedy manner by choosing the next optimal selection s;,
given the previous set of optimal selections S’_, = {s],--+.s;_,}
and recursively defining with S; = S;_, U {s,}. MMR greedily
populates the result set according to the following criteria:

sy = argmax [ASim(u, sg) — (1 — A)Sime(si, s¢)] (1)

steD\St,

Here, similarity metric Sim, measures user-item relevance (i.e.,
recommendation score), metric Simz measures item-item similarity,
and the parameter A ¢€ [0, 1] trades off relevance and diversity. In
the case of s}, the maximization term is vacuous (=0).

From an inspection of Equation 1, one can easily identify the
key weaknesses of MMR that we seek to address in this work: (1) it
directly sacrifices relevance to achieve diversity [19]; (2) in its stan-
dard form, the item diversification Sim, is generic and untargeted
(U-MMR) [11] though we later define a targeted variant (T-MMR)
for additional comparison; (3) it requires a quadratic complexity
computation of pairwise similarity measures between items.

3 METHODOLOGY

VAEs for Collaborative Filtering: The impressive generalization
and reconstruction ability of the VAE model is particularly attrac-
tive to the recommendation community and has inspired many
recent deep learning-based recommendation models [9, 10, 16]. Fig-
ure 3(a) shows the basic VAE-CF model for recommendation, where
a (sparse) vector of user preferences 7, over n items are encoded by
the VAE [8] into a Gaussian-distributed latent preference embed-
ding Z, of width d. Z, is then stochastically decoded to a (dense)
reconstruction 7, that generalizes user preferences to unobserved
items. Formally, VAE-CF optimizes the following objective over the
respective parameters ¢ and @ of the encoder and decoder:

Miloge Gu) = 7 [Egy ult) Hogpo Fu l2u)] - KElgg Zu lFu) lp Eu) |]
. . (2)

In practice, the approximation of user distribution qg(Zul7u) is
usually a Normal distribution with learned parameters jz, and Dy.

In our implementation, we use a one-layer decoder such that the
weights of the decoder can be directly used as item embeddings,
yenxd where the i“ vector X; is the jth weight of the decoder that
corresponds to the i item and n is the number of items. From
the latent embedding space, we can obtain the user embeddings as
zmxd where the u‘ vector Z,, is the latent preference embedding
Z, of user u and m is the number of users.

Concept Activation Vectors: Existing work for conversational rec-
ommender systems [17] leveraged the CAV [7] methodology with
the VAE-CF framework to determine the alignment of keyphrase
embeddings with user embeddings and applied a Bayesian update
to user beliefs after each critique [17].

Here, we propose two methods for generating CAVs: I-CAVs
and U-CAVs. We define a CAV as the normal to a hyperplane that
separates two opposing subtopics (e.g. Republican vs. Democratic)
in the embedding space as shown in Figure 3(b). For I-CAVs, we
sample k items from each subtopic to form two subsets of items, Jj,
and Ti. from decoder matrix X”*@, To obtain the activation vector
uj € Re, multiple linear classifiers are trained to distinguish G,!
and Fj,” and the averaged classifier is used as dj. U-CAVs sample
from the user embeddings, gmxd to form two subsets of users, U,!

and 24,”. Similarly, the activation vector, dy, is generated using the
averaged linear classifier between Z{,' and U,”.

Targeted Diversification VAE-CF (TD-VAE-CF): TD-VAE-CF
applies a targeted CAV direction to update the user-embeddings
from VAE-CF in the latent space. After we generate CAV ¢ using
either user or item embeddings, we update a user-embedding by
subtracting its projection on the CAV with a parameter A:

3 = Zu * a.

2u=2u~ (1 Nae (3)

where Z, is the updated user embedding for user u. As shown
in Figure 3(b), the updated user embedding moves closer to the
hyperplane that separates two subtopics. The parameter A is taken
from [0, 1] which controls the degree of update. Finally, the updated
user-embedding is decoded using the one-layer decoder in VAE-CF
to the (dense) reconstruction, has where the user preference rating
for the opposing subtopic would increase as shown in Figure 3(c).

4 EXPERIMENTS

We now experimentally compare the recommendation and diversifi-
cation quality of our proposed TD-VAE-CF with a baseline VAE-CF
model (i.e., TD-VAE-CF with A = 1) and MMR-diversified variants
of VAE-CF to address the following research questions:

¢ RQ1 - Relevance vs. Diversity: Is TD-VAE-CF able to
maintain relevance and achieve diversity better than MMR?

¢ RQ2 - Targeted Diversification: Does TD-VAE-CF effec-
tively distribute items in the targeted latent direction?

¢ RQ3 - Running Time: Is TD-VAE-CF efficient vs. MMR?

Appendix A provides a methodology and experimental results
for a variation of the TD-VAE-CF methodology to “flatten” the filter
bubble rather than “neutralize” it as we currently do in Section 3. All
code to reproduce the experimental results is available on github.!

4.1 Datasets

We conduct experiments on two datasets: Reddit for recommenda-
tion of communities, and Yelp for recommendation of restaurants.
We follow the same preprocessing steps as in previous work [15, 18]
and randomly select 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10%
for testing. For Reddit, we select two spectra to diversify along with
two subtopics for each spectrum: politics (Republican vs. Demo-
cratic) and gender (Men vs. Women). Since the Reddit communities
are sparse and there are, on average, less than ten communities cor-
responding to one subtopic, U-CAVs are used for Reddit by selecting
the users that have interacted exclusively with the communities
within one subtopic in the spectrum (e.g., DemocraticSocialism for

Democratic and Republicans for Republican). Similarly, the two spec-
tra we choose for Yelp are health (Deep Fried vs. Salad) and meat
consumption (Vegetarian vs. BBQ). The labels for each restaurant
are generated using the ten most common key phrases in the user
reviews (e.g. DeepFried, BBQ, etc.). We use I-CAVs for Yelp since
there is a sufficient number of items for each subtopic to generate
a representable CAV. Since there is no need to perform targeted
diversification on users who haven’t interacted with the targeted

direction, we used two subsets of Reddit dataset on politics and
gender. The statistics for the datasets are summarized in Table 1.

4.2 Metrics

We evaluate the relevance of top-k ranking performance using Nor-
malized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) as done in previous
work [10, 16]. The diversity of top-k items along the targeted spec-
trum is evaluated using S-Precision [19] and Harmonic Mean of
Subtopic Probabilities (HMSP) since these two metrics can capture
the distribution difference of the two ends of the targeted spectrum.

NDCG: NDCG is a measure of ranking quality using Discounted
Cumulative Gain (DCG). Formally, it is defined as:

rel; NDCG@K = DCG@K (4)

.g2 (i + 1) IDCG@K

K
DCG@K =
@ 2d lo
i=1
where rei; is the graded relevance score of the i?” itemandI DCG@K
is ideal discounted cumulative gain.

S-Precision: S-Precision reflects the number of subtopics covered
in the recommended items and is derived from S-Recall that mea-
sures the number of subtopics covered among the top-k items:

UX_ subtopics(d;
S-Recall@K = [Ming subtopics dil (5)
nA
where n, is the number of subtopics. If S is a recommendation
system, we define minRank(S,r) as the minimal rank K at which
the ranking produced by S has S-Recall r. Then, we can define:

minRank(Sopt, 1)

minRank(S,r) ° (6)

S-Precision@r =

where Sopr is a system that produce the optimal ranking (ie.,
minRank(Sopr, 1) is the smallest K for a S-Recall r). Since we focus
on two subtopics, we use S-Precision@1 such that the minRank(S, r)
would be the minimum rank that covers both subtopics.

Harmonic Mean of Subtopic Probabilities (HMSP): Harmonic
Mean of Subtopic Probabilities (HMSP) measures the empirical
prevalence of each subtopic in the recommendation list; we choose
the harmonic mean since it is strictly greater than or equal to the
minimum subtopic probability and thus guarantees at least that
much coverage for each subtopic. In contrast, the arithmetic mean
could be relatively high even if one subtopic probability is 0.

Given empirical probabilities p4 and pg of subtopics A and B in
the recommendation list, HMSP = 2Pape

4.3 Methods Compared
We compare the following (diversified) recommendation methods:

e TD-VAE-CF: Our Targeted Diversification VAE-CF as de-

fined in Section 3 with U-CAVs (Reddit) and I-CAVs (Yelp).

Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss is used for VAE-CF.

100 CAVs are generated using 10 embeddings for each of the

two subtopics which are randomly sampled and the final

CAV is the mean of the 100 CAVs.

VAE-CF: The undiversified baseline collaborative filtering

system defined in Section 3 (VAE-CF = TD-VAE-CF @ A = 1).

Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss is used.

@ U-MMR: Untargeted MMR defines Sim, as the VAE-CF user-
item embedding dot product and Simg as VAE-CF item-item
embedding dot product (VAE-CF = U-MMR @ A = 1).

e@ T-MMR: To see if we can achieve a Targeted MMR, we first
project the user and item embeddings on the CAV to obtain
their preference scores in the targeted spectrum. Then, the
similarity metrics Sim, and Simg are computed by taking
the negative absolute value of the difference between the
user-item and item-item scores, respectively.

 

4.4 Performance Evaluation

RQ1 - Relevance vs. Diversity: Overall, the targeted variation of
MMR (T-MMR) demonstrates relevance scores that are extremely
low (0.0043 for Yelp, 0.0036 for Reddit Politics, and 0.0038 for Reddit
Gender on NDCG@50). Therefore, in the remaining results, we omit
T-MMR and only report results of the three other methods that have
acceptable relevance scores. The results of relevance and diversity
on TD-VAE-CF, VAE-CF, and U-MMR are shown in Figure 4. For
any fixed level of NDCG recommendation performance (x-axis), the
TD-VAE-CF method sirictly dominates U-MMR’s diversity metrics.
Since U-MMR performs untargeted diversification while the metric
for diversity is measured along the targeted direction, U-MMR’s
diversity and relevance may both decrease for some datasets.

RQ2 - Targeted Diversification: The distribution of recommended
items on the target CAV are shown in Figure 1 and 5. We see a clear
shift of the distribution from one side to the middle, showing the
diversified recommendations from TD-VAE-CF are well-balanced
between the two targeted subtopics of the spectrum, unlike U-MMR.
RQ3 - Running Time: Empirical running times for TD-VAE-CF
and U-MMR are shown in Figure 6 (T-MMR would be identical to
U-MMR). U-MMR reranks items according to Equation 1. At the Kth
rank selection step U-MMR compares all non-selected items with

K - 1 selected items. Therefore, the time complexity for UU-MMR
is O(mnK*) where m is the number of users, n is the number of
items, and K is the number of recommendations to generate. For
TD-VAE-CF, the time complexity can be divided into two parts:
the user embedding update requires O(m), and user-item rating
generation and sorting need O(mn) to generate the ratings and
O(m(K + Klog(K))) to select and sort the top-K ratings. Then, the
total time complexity for TD-VAE-CF is:

O(m +mn+ m(K + Klog(K))) = O(m(K + K log(K) +n)), (7)

Since the complexity of U-MMR has a quadratic growth with respect
to K while TD-VAE-CF has a dominant term of K log(K) growth,
the time difference of each increases drastically with higher K.

Conclusion: Overall, in comparison to popular MMR-based diver-
sification methods, these results collectively confirm that our novel
TD-VAE-CF can mitigate filter bubble effects via targeted modula-
tion of a user’s latent preference embeddings, while maintaining
relevance and having lower computational complexity than MMR.

A FLATTENING THE FILTER BUBBLE BY
INJECTING NOISE IN THE TARGETED CAV
DIMENSION

One side effect of diversifying with the TD-VAE-CF methodology
of Section 3 is that it tends to neutralize the targeted spectrum
by shifting the user’s latent preference towards the center of the
spectrum. One caveat is that this method tends to recommend
fewer items that are at the extremes of the spectrum, which can
alternately be seen as a benefit or drawback according to the intent
of the diversification. We can observe this effect in Figure 1 and 5:
while the distributions of the recommended items shifted to the
middle, the range of the distributions also decrease. In this section,
we present a method that can diversify across both sides of the
targeted spectrum by effectively “flattening” the distribution via
the injection of Gaussian noise.

To achieve this, first we update the user-embedding, Z,,, following
the same method in Section 3 with A = 0 which removes preference
information of the user in the targeted CAV direction d:

 

Zy 0

4 > ud.

Zu =Zy A =U (8)
llell?

Then, we compute perturbations of the user’s latent embedding 2
n times along the targeted CAV direction ¢ by computing

2 =2,-al8 (9)
where j € {1,...,n} and a7 ~ N(0, 0") randomly determines the
magnitude of noise injection in the CAV dimension (sometimes
sampling more extreme ends of the CAV spectrum). Clearly, as o

increases, the amount of extreme content from both ends of the
spectrum that is sampled also increases.

Finally, the n perturbed user-embeddings zh are decoded to pro-
duce n VAE-CF recommendation predictions rj; for each item i and
perturbation j. The final rating score r; for item i is computed by
averaging the n scores produced by each perturbed user embedding:

12
nay ny (10)
=

The resulting targeted spectrum distributions are shown in Fig-
ure 7 and the results of relevance and diversity analysis are shown
in Figure 8. We fixed n at 10 and varied o within (0, 1, 2,5, 10, 20).
When o = 0, the perturbation process does not change the user
embeddings and it is the same method as TD-VAE-CF in Section 3
with A = 0.

We can clearly see that the distribution is flattened with higher o
and a wider range of items on the targeted spectrum, although still
balanced and thus yielding relatively high diversity measures. The
diversity continues to increase with higher o while the relevance de-
creases more rapidly than TD-VAE-CF since extreme recommendations
are less likely to be relevant for most users.

Whether one should “neutralize” the curve (and remove extreme
content for potentially sensitive users) using TD-VAE-CF as pro-
posed in Section 3 or “flatten” the curve as shown here (and recom-
mend content at all points on the spectrum - even extreme points
of view from both sides) is a decision that ultimately rests with the
recommendation system designer and depends on the desiderata
that motivate the need for diversification w.r.t. the target audience.

Figure 8: NDCG@50 vs. S-Precision and HMSP for four spectra of two datasets with different o values (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20). Higher
o values (higher standard deviation) are marked with higher opacity. o = 0 for TD-VAE-CF is the same as 4 = 0 without any
remapping. U-MMR results are the same as Section 4 since its not possible to perform the same remapping process for U-MMR.
