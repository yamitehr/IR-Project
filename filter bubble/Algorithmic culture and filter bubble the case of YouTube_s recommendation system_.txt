ABSTRACT

Day by day, algorithms of all kinds are becoming part of our daily routines and help us
to improve our daily lives. The recommendation systems of many platforms we daily
use, are using different algorithms in order to function properly. A strand of the relevant
research is currently exploring the impact of algorithms on the identity of users and
culture more generally, which leads to the notion of “algorithmic culture”. Pariser
(2011) first wrote about the phenomenon of the “filter bubble” and how they are being
created, both by users and algorithms. Yet, it still remains controversial today if the
phenomenon is real, and has split the academic community, as many tried to prove that
such a phenomenon is not created by the algorithms. The YouTube platform has one of
the most widely used recommendation systems and will be the focus of analysis for this
thesis. The thesis examines the platform of YouTube for the existence of a commercial
filter bubble in the case of music culture and ponders its impact on identity, or in this
case, the music taste of users. Following the method of algorithm auditing, two fake
accounts were created and loaded with two different types of music content in order to
impersonate two different types of user with different music taste. By analyzing the
recommended videos of the two accounts we show how different kinds of bubbles
emerged through the recommendation of the platform, and how the platform of

YouTube can faction as technology of the self.

1 Introduction

It was the 13" to 14 of August 2019, when a group of LGBTQs YouTubers joined a
class action lawsuit suing YouTube for discrimination, deceptive business practices and
unlawful restraint of speech. As reported by The Guardian, producers and independent
film makers joined the lawsuit, suing YouTube for restricting their content and
effectively trying to push them off the platform (Kleeman, 2019, Nov 22). In the same
article, The Guardian attempting to explain YouTube’s alleged practices, writes: “Some
think it is to appease advertisers wary of being associated with anything on YouTube
that could be viewed as controversial”. Taking this into consideration, can we really rely
on algorithms and recommendation systems as a tool to help us find information, or

should we have a more suspicious and critical attitude toward them?

Nowadays, we encounter the increase impact of datafication on our lives, which
refers to “the quantification of aspects of life previously experienced in qualitative, non-
numeric form, such as communication, relationships, health and fitness, transport and
mobility, democratic participation, leisure and consumption” (Kennedy, 2018: 18) or
“the transformation of part, if not most, of our lives into computable data” (Cheney -
Lippold, 2017: 276-278 [e-book]).

This data — which are often “big” data — are collected and used by commercial
platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Skype, free e-mail services etc. To use
this data, platforms routinely employ search, filtering and sorting algorithms, leading, as
a result, to the algorithmic mediation of users’ everyday life, in aspects such as

friendships, interests, information searches, expressions of tastes and many more.

All the above is the result of a pipeline of tools used for collecting and analyzing
user-generated data. The sole purpose of these tools is the creation of models
representing users’ behaviors, that will then be used for feeding users with “interesting”
content. This thesis focuses on the core element of this pipeline, the technology known
as “Recommender Systems”. Recommender systems, using various information
collected from various sources, and relating this information with a user’s behavior,

suggests to a user content closer to his/her interests, called personalized content (Ricci
et al., 2011). Yet, by doing so, there is a high risk of reproducing and suggesting to a
user very similar content creating “echo chambers”. “Echo chambers”, as employed by
(Dutton et al., 2017), suggest that users are exposed to the same kind of information
with which they have already been exposed to and are familiar with. Pariser (2011),
based on the idea of the echo chamber, wrote about the creation of a “filter bubble”, a
phenomenon that is encouraged by recommendation algorithms and in some cases by

users, so that they come across information that is similar to their own interests.

Recommendation algorithms map our preferences against other users’
preferences, at times suggesting new or forgotten bits of culture for us to encounter.
Music, as an aspect of users’ culture, will play an important role in this study. This
thesis will explore the existence of a filter bubble through the recommendation
algorithms on the platform of YouTube in the case of mainstream and alternative music
content. As argued by Cayari (2011), the platform of YouTube has become a powerful
space that affords new ways to consume, create and share music, while Allen et al.
(2017) consider YouTube one of the three most popular means of discovering music,
along with recommendations from friends and family, and the mainstream AM and FM

radios.

Taking into consideration the impact of algorithms on a daily basis, and the
polarization that may occur by the filter bubble phenomenon, in different aspects of
users’ lives generally and in shaping users’ music taste specifically, the research
question that this thesis will attempt to answer is: In the case of music, does the
recommendation system of the YouTube platform provide more mainstream content

than alternative, creating as a result a commercial filter bubble?

YouTube is a platform that is famous for its user-generated videos. On the other
hand, many commercial music companies are using the platform to share their music
videos and songs with users all over the world. Separating music content into two
different kinds will help us examine if the recommendation algorithms of the platform
provide more content from those companies (mainstream), than from other, not so
famous companies or users (alternative). Our hypothesis is that the algorithms, in order

to increase the monetization of content and the platform’s profit, will provide more
mainstream content and as a result the existence of a commercial filter bubble will be
revealed.

In the next chapters we will discuss why it was considered necessary to study
this problem, the theoretical background that the research focused on, a literature review
of similar studies, the methodology that was used to collect and analyse the data of the
research, the results from the analysis of the data and how those results are linked to the
existing literature and previous research work. At the end, further research ideas are

suggested.

1.1 Problem — Necessity of study

It is estimated that in each day that passes, 1 billion hours of videos are watched by
users, on the platform of YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/about/press/). As one of
the biggest video platforms, if not the biggest, YouTube has often been the object of
research with contradictory results, especially on the investigation about the existence of
a filter bubble. Moreover, YouTube as a video sharing platform, with different themes
and genres of videos, has been examined mostly for the existence of ideological filter

bubbles, such as the extreme-right and the extreme-left filter bubble.

Moreover, as internet users, we encounter everyday different kinds of
algorithms. As we encounter social products with the mediation of algorithms, the result
is the danger to be driven into more mainstream paths, limiting originality and

creativity. Those algorithms are referred as cultural algorithms or algorithmic culture.

On the one hand, there are several studies than confirm the existence of filter
bubbles both on YouTube and other platforms using recommendation algorithms. On
the other hand, there are a few studies proving that something like a filter bubble does
not exist. This fact increases the importance for further study of the platforms’
recommendation system and so does the relative gap in the literature regarding the
impact of the recommendation algorithms of YouTube and the creation of filter bubbles
in the case of using the platform to find music. Furthermore, a possible filter bubble that
is created by the platform’s recommendation algorithms, as Allen et al. (2017) have
argued, will reduce users’ exposure to music that they are not familiar with. As a result

of this practice there will be further polarization on users’ tastes which can be
considered a negative aspect, as it limits the possibilities for users to come across
information, knowledge, ideologies and cultural content, different from what they are

used to.

1.2 Theoretical background

In this chapter we will focus on and discuss the main theoretical concept which is at the
heart of this thesis, which is the “filter bubble” concept, as well as other important and

broader theories which inform this study and are connected to the concept under study.
1.2.1 Filter bubble

To begin with, the idea of filter bubbles was coined by Pariser (2011) in his
book titled “The filter bubble: What the Internet is hiding from you”. As an idea is based
on the theory of the echo chamber which, according to Dutton et al. (2017), might
restrict access to a more diverse array of views and other political information than one
might otherwise come in contact with, either online or offline. In the case of the online
environment we have an algorithmic filtering, while on the case of the offline social
world, we have a social filtering. When social filtering is transferred to the online
activities is referred to as “confirmation bias”, which attracts people to information that
confirms rather than challenges their preexisting views. Pariser (2011) referred to the
filter bubble as the preferential attention to viewpoints similar to those already held by
an individual, which is explicitly encouraged by social media companies. Namely, to
increase metrics like engagement and advertise revenue, recommendation systems tend
to connect users with information already similar to their current beliefs. Pariser (2011)
identifies the emergence of filter bubbles in two possible ways. First, the filter bubble
can appear through the suggestions of recommendation algorithms, and second, through
users’ activities on the web and the choices of content s/he makes. Or, in most cases, as
a combination of both, because if a user already has a diverse information or cultural

“diet”, it is difficult for a filter bubble to emerge.
1.2.2 Algorithmic culture

The concerns over the filter bubble(s) do not exist in a vacuum. They are
situated in a broader critical discussion of what is called “algorithmic governance”, a
term used to refer to “a more evidence-based and data-driven than traditional
governance” (Just & Latzer, 2017: 245). A key tool in this process is automated
algorithmic selection, which “governs a wide spectrum of individual action, and is
heavily used for various societal functions”, as algorithms co-govern or co-determine
what can be found online, what is seen and found, is produced, is considered relevant, is
anticipated and is consumed (ibid: 247). This transformed form of governance is based
on proprietary big data that tends to strengthen selection criteria oriented on special
interests concemed with profit maximization, thus weakening public interest goals and
social responsibility in the construction of reality and eventually consolidating and
creating new social inequalities (Just & Latzer, 2017). The filter bubble can appear as an
effect of or can be used as a tool by the algorithmic governance in order to maximize

profits, for example through advertisements, and to construct a reality.
1.2.3 Recommender systems

Recommender systems are a significant part of algorithmic governance, as they
use (big) data generated by users in order to create a set of suggestions for them (Ricci
et al., 2011). The most widely used form of recommender systems is known as
Collaborating Filtering (Breese et al., 1998). Collaborating filtering, based on the
assumption that users with similar “tastes” (interests, behaviors, etc.) in the past will
have similar “tastes” in the future, clusters users according to their “tastes”. Then,
utilizing seen behaviors (1.¢., clicking on a YouTube video) from members of a cluster,

suggests similar behaviors to other users of the cluster.

The platform of YouTube heavily provides recommendation services and, as
O'Callaghan et al. (2015) write, these recommendations are sets of videos that are
presented to users, based on factors such as co-visitation and viewing history. Co-
visitation is a factor based on machine learning algorithms, a type of algorithms that
suggest to users videos that are based on what other users with similar characteristics
tend to watch. The recommendation algorithms are an important factor in the creation of

the filter bubble, both in the case of co-visitation and of a user’s viewing history. Also,
as argued by Karakayali et al. (2018), recommendation algorithms can function as

“technologies of control” or as “technologies of the self”.
1.2.4 Technologies of the self

Foucault, as discussed by Karakayali et al. (2018), contended that in modernity
there is shift from how subjects are produced in knowledge-power networks to how
human beings turn themselves into subjects. To confirm this idea, Karakayali et al.
describe a cycle that evaluates the choices of the user, as can be seen in Figure 1. First,
algorithms take into consideration the online and offline activities of a user and create a
set of recommendations. Then, by the user’s choices on these recommendations the
algorithms take a recursive feedback of the data and create a new set of
recommendations resulting in the “objectified” aspect of the user. But taking into
consideration that users can change or modify their activities any time, the algorithms
must begin from the point that calculates the users’ online and offline activities; and so
the circle begins again. Therefore, we need to consider how “technologies of the self”
can impact users’ behaviour and affect their point of view in subjects that are

inseparable with cultural decisions.

Karakayali et al., 2018)
1.2.5 Algorithmic culture

Algorithmic governance in general and recommendation systems in particular
also affect the realm of cultural production and consumption. Kroeber & Clyde
Kluckhohn (1963, cited in Hallinan & Striphas, 2016: 3) wrote that the word “culture”
is really hard to define and that there are more than 164 different definitions of it.
Hallinan & Striphas (2016: 3), in their attempt to define it, refer to culture as “particular
modes of fostering human refinement and their underlying frameworks of valuation and
authority, patterns of social difference, commonality and interactions”. They also
introduce the idea of “algorithmic culture”, as “the use of computational processes to
sort, classify and hierarchize people, places, objects and ideas and also the habits of
thought, conduct and expression that arise in relationship to those processes” (ibid).
Based on the case of Netflix, they discuss how the “production of sophisticated
recommendations produces greater customer satisfaction which produces more
customer data which in turn produce more sophisticated recommendations, and so on,
resulting — theoretically — in a closed commercial loop in which culture conforms to,
more than it confronts, its users” (ibid: 122). Hallinan & Striphas raise the question
“what happens when [...] algorithms become important arbiters of culture”. This issue
is taken up by this thesis, which is empirically exploring this assumption in the case of

music recommendations in YouTube.
1.2.6 The Frankfurt School

It is true that we live in a capitalis system, where over-consumption does not
refer only to money and products, but the free market has a major impact on the cultural
consumption as well. In the Frankfurt School, culture is represented “as the sum total of
activities that possess the aura of intellectuality or spirituality, that is, the arts and
sciences” (Piccone, 1978). As part of the arts and culture, music was a subject of critical
scrutiny under the critical theory of the Frankfurt School. Writing about music, the
question that the philosophers of the Frankfurt School posed was the relation between
music and the public. “This question cannot be explored independently of the matter of
the function and influence of music society” (Tottoéia, 2015, author’s translation). One
philosopher that devoted a significant amount of time in his work to find an answer was

Theodor W. Adorno. Some of his books that show the connection between consuming
music and the impact on culture are “Philosophy of new music” (1949) and the “Essays
on music” (2002), which is a book comprised by 27 essays written by Adorno. Taking
into consideration that the philosophers of the Frankfurt School were considered
Marxist intellectuals, we could make a connection between music consumption and the
role of algorithms. Adorno always shared the view that society takes anything that tries
to criticize its power and makes it part of the mainstream culture (in To1togia, 2015), a
process which is called “appropriation”. The question, then becomes, do

recommendation algorithms play any part in this process?

1.3 Literature Review

The filter bubble phenomenon has become the subject of study in several research
works. On the one hand, there are studies which reinforce the argument for the existence
of the bubble in search engines and news recommendation (Flaxman et al. 2016; Dylko
et al. 2017; Beam, 2014), while on the other hand there are several studies that refute
the filter bubble effects, in cases like the search engines, music consumption and news
consumption (Nikolov et al. 2015; Hosanagar et al. 2013; Dutton et al. 2017). In this
part we will go deeper in three studies, two of which examine the existence of a filter
bubble in the case of music on two different platforms with music recommendation
algorithms, and one that examines the existence of ideological bubble in the platform of
YouTube.

O'Callaghan et al. (2013), in their article “The extreme right filter bubble”,
examined the recommendation system on the platform of YouTube asking whether it
creates an extreme-right filter bubble. To do so, they first created a set of seed channels
for extreme-right content from links propagated by extreme-right Twitter accounts and
related channels, which were determined by using the results returned by YouTube’s
related video services. To devise their method, they first generated an aggregated
ranking of related channels for each seed channel. Next, they generated TF-IDF channel
document vectors and then categorized the identified topics according to the set created.
Lastly, they categorized the channels based on their topic weight and investigated
whether an extreme-right filter bubble exists. Their main finding was that users who
access an extreme-right video are highly likely to be recommended further extreme-

right content, proving consequently the existence of an ideological filter bubble.
Allen et al. (2017), in their paper titled “The Effects of Music Recommendation
Engines on the Filter Bubble Phenomenon’, set out to examine the contribution of the
music recommendation algorithm of “Pandora” to the filter bubble phenomenon, in
comparison to more mainstream radio services. For their research they recruited 18
participants. All participants were given one temporary email address and by the use of
a google chrome extension, the investigators tracked the participants’ actions through
the website of “Pandora” (to collect information about the music recommendation
algorithm) and “last.fm” (to collect information about the mainstream radio). In the
latter case, participants had to listen to 10 to 12 hours of music from a pre-determined
set of radio stations. After this process, each participant was interviewed on his/her
experience with both services. The result of their study was that, through the
comparison of “Pandora” and AM/FM radio listening habits, a cultural filter bubble
effect does occur with “Pandora” as it was less likely for the participants to challenge
their music preferences on the service. In this case the filter bubble was induced both

from users and the algorithms.

In their work titled “Recommendation Systems as Technologies of the Self:
Algorithmic Control and the Formation of Music Taste”, Karakayali et al. (2018) aimed
to show how music taste emerges as a significant aspect of the user’s self and how it
becomes an object of care through his/her interactions with last.fm. The main object of
their work was the role played by a recommender system in the care of music taste as an
aspect of the self. To do that they delved into the experiences of the users of the music
recommendation website “last.fm”. Their data sources were the comments of the users
in several forums and ten in-depth interviews with users of the website. Their finding
was that “last.fm” does not orient its users toward a definite “music taste” and its effects
can be described more as disorientation for the users. From the results of this study, we
conclude that, in the case of the music recommendation system “last.fm”, a filter bubble

did not occur.

Judging from the findings of previous studies similar to this thesis, it is
confirmed there is contradictory evidence regarding the existence (or not) of the
phenomenon of filter bubble in the cultural/music field. The first study discussed shows

that the recommendation system of YouTube indeed creates an ideological filter bubble
in the case of extreme-right content. The other two studies examine two different music

recommendation algorithms with diverse results.

2 Research Methodology

The method of this thesis is a relatively recent method called “algorithm audit”
(Sandvig et al., 2014), which is adapted from the classic audit study, a field experiment
used in social sciences usually to detect discrimination (ibid). More specifically, we will
employ the subcategory of “sock puppet audit” (ibid), which entails the impersonation
of users by creating false user accounts. Thus, the proposed study is based on an
experimental design, and, following the processes of the algorithm audits, it used a
mixed method with both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Qualitative analysis was
used to categorize the music content, as described below, whereas the quantitative

component refers to the statistical analysis of the collected data.

The first step of the research within the current thesis was the creation of the
accounts that would be loaded with content. Since the YouTube platform belongs to the
Google company, in order to login to the platform two different Google accounts were
created. The first account was loaded with mainstream content in order to impersonate a
user with mainstream or commercial music tastes and listening habits. The second
account was loaded with alternative content following a similar rationale. The
procedure to load the accounts with content entailed “watching” video content on
YouTube for a period of one month (to ensure that a user profile was consolidated) and
each account was loaded with one and half hour of content per day. The entire rationale
of this approach was based on the assumption that YouTube personalizes its suggestions
to users, according to their observed habits. The procedure began at the end of January
2020 and ended at the first days of March 2020.

Secondly, the categorization of the mainstream and alternative music content
took place. As far as the mainstream content is concerned, the decision was made to
identify mainstream content through YouTube channels, and more specifically the
channel “Universal Music Group” (UMG), which is “the world’s leading music

company”, according to their website (https://www.universalmusic.com/company/) and

10
one of the three major players in the global music market; in fact, in 2019 it reached
30% of the total market share in the recorded music market and added more revenue
than Warner Music and Sony Music combined (Music Industry Blog, 2020, March 5).
Additionally, based on research inside the YouTube platform, one more successful
music provider was identified, the VEVO channel, which is a multinational video
hosting service owned by Universal Music Group (UMG) and Sony Music
Entertainment (SME), along with other music companies (Wikipedia, Vevo). Both
channels host some of the most mainstream and popular music videos of the YouTube
platform. In the case of the alternative music content, Wikipedia was used as a source of
categorization. A Wikipedia page (https://en. wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock
retrieved 05/05/2020) categorizes the alternative music content in two big genres,
alternative rock and alternative metal. Each of these genres had a list of sub-genres.
Based on this typology, a song was deemed alternative if it belonged to one of the
genres or subgenres of those lists. An additional criterion was the popularity of the song
or band. Namely, as specific songs or bands of alternative music become a huge success
also among mainstream audiences, we worked with a narrow definition of alternative
music, excluding songs or bands that are hugely popular within the YouTube platform
from loading the account and thus “training” the algorithm. For example, the song
“Chop suey” from the alternative metal band “System of a down”, was not used to load
the alternative user, as the video today (10/05/2020) has almost 1 billion views. Also, a
list was created with all the alternative artists that were found during the process,
independently from their popularity, in order to be used for the categorization of the

content that would be collected.

As Davidson et al. (2010) write, recommendations on YouTube are featured in
two primary locations: the “Homepage” and the “Browse” page. Based on the
researcher’s engagement with the platform, in the Browse page there are
recommendations that are related to the platform; for example, a visit to the “Browse”
page towards the end of the year (visited in 2019), the first recommended video is the
“YouTube Rewind video”, a video that the company of YouTube creates at the end of
each year summing up the platform’s activities. As can be seen in Figure 2, in a random
visit conducted by the researcher, the recommendations of the homepage are more

relevant and personalized to the user compared to the “Browse” page.

Figure 2: Recommended videos from Homepage

Based on these observations, the decision was made to begin the process of data
collection following a path from the “Homepage” to recommended videos on the right
side of the screen, as seen in Figure 3. From the researcher’s experience and
experimentation with the platform, the videos that appeared on the right side of the page

are personalized and relevant to the user’s preferences and previous viewing history.

 

 

 

 

Figure 3: Recommendation in YouTube

After the long process of loading the accounts with content, we logged in with
each account, and from the “Homepage” we selected the first recommended song-
related video, avoiding any other content irrelevant to this study, e.g. sports videos,

video games videos, etc. Next, from the landing page, i.c., the YouTube page of the

12
selected music video, the first recommended video was selected, i.e., the first video that

appeared on the right side of the page, where a list of recommended video appears.

At this point, with the use of Python language, a program was created to
automatically extract useful information from the recommended videos, which was the
id of the videos, the title, the channel that uploaded the video, the views, the seconds
since the publication of the video, the “Recommended for you” tag (if it existed) and the
order in which the video appeared. For the programme to work, we had to save the html
code of the YouTube page and then run the programme to save the information
mentioned above in a csv file. Papadamou et al. (2019) found that through a 10-click
rate, a toddler can come across disturbing video recommendations. Based on the same
idea, we followed a 10-click path, which means that we clicked on the first video from
the “Homepage”, the html of the page was saved and then clicked on the first
recommended video. This procedure was repeated 10 times, and for 10 days straight for
each account. As a result, a database of 2000 videos, along with their information, was
created. The next step was the qualitative analysis of the videos and their categorization
into mainstream and alternative (or not song-related videos). Following Davidson et al.
(2010: 294), we did not use metadata from the videos for this purpose, such as tags and
description of the video, because “video metadata can be non-existent, incomplete,
outdated, or simply incorrect”. Therefore, the categorization of the videos was
completed manually by the researcher, drawing on the typology of the artists on
Wikipedia, through the list that was created for the alternative artists and the two
YouTube channels. Also when an artist was neither on the channels nor on the list, the
researcher manually searched information about the artist’s genre. Finally, the analysis
of the collected information was completed by statistical analysis and the results will be

presented in the next chapter of the thesis.

3 Results/ Findings

3.1 Artists appearance

Through the analysis that follows, the main purpose was to answer the research
question of the thesis: In the case of music, does the recommendation system of the
YouTube platform provide more mainstream content than alternative, creating as a
result a commercial filter bubble? In order to analyse our data, we performed a
statistical analysis on the 2000 collected videos using SPSS. In order to investigate the
existence of a filter bubble, we first explored the appearance of mainstream artists in the
alternative music “fan” account’s recommended videos and the appearance of
alternative artists in the mainstream music “fan” account’s recommended videos. If the
recommendations corresponded to the accounts’ registered tastes, we could speak about
the existence of a filter bubble. Moreover, if mainstream content prevailed in both
accounts, we could speak of commercial filter bubble, in the sense of YouTube
promoting popular musical content irrespective of the users’ preferences. The findings
confirm the former assumption. As seen in Table 1, the vast majority of the
recommended songs recommended to the mainstream music “fan” were mainstream
music songs (90%, n=841); similarly, 96% (n=899) recommended to the alternative
music “fan” fall into the alternative music genre. This difference is statistically
significant [x°(1, n=1869)=1395, p<.001). Yet, quite unexpectedly, the number of
alternative videos that appeared as recommended to the mainstream music fan (10%)
was higher than the number of mainstream videos that appeared as recommended to the
alternative music fan (4%). The reason we consider the results of this analysis
unexpected emerges from the assumption that more mainstream content would be
recommended to both fans, in order to propel the profit of the platform, which as a

result would be a clear creation of a commercial filter bubble.

3.2. Recommended videos: views and popularity-age

Because of this unexpected result, the analysis continued to examine the views
of the recommended videos on both of the above cases. In the case of alternative content
(Table 2), the mainstream music fan was recommended content with significantly more
views (M = 215137822.9, SD = 369248343), compared to the alternative music fan (M
= 5431534.4, SD = 13327210) (p<.001). The same goes for the mainstream content
(Table 3): again, the mainstream music fan was recommended content with significantly
more views (M = 345739592, SD = 577670779), compared to the alternative music fan
(M = 2162700, SD = 6453661.5) (p<.001).

Table 3: Views of mainstream content

But those numbers are depended and can be affected by the time the video was
uploaded on the platform of YouTube. If, for example, two videos had the same number
of views but were uploaded three or four years apart, we consider that those two
numbers of views are not entirely comparable. For this reason, a new variable was
created named “popularity - age”. This variable was created by dividing the number of

the views with the seconds that had passed since the upload of the video. Then, the

15
analysis was computed again but this time using the new variable of popularity-age of
the videos instead of the views. In the case of the alternative music fan (see Table 4),
the minimum value of popularity of the mainstream songs was 0.0003638020 and the
maximum 0.5921270420 (M = 0.04, SD = 0.10), while in the case of the mainstream
music fan (see Table 5) the minimum value of popularity of the alternative songs was
0.0093903710 and the maximum value was 15.69593706 (M = 1.17, SD = 2.73). In the
alternative music fan, the mainstream videos that were suggested had a lower value of
popularity even compared to the value of popularity of the alternative suggested videos
in the mainstream music fan. This can be considered as one step forward to the creation
of a filter bubble but not of a commercial one, as the assumption, but a different filter

bubble in cach fan, according to the popularity-age of it.

3.3. The “Recommended for you” videos

The researcher noticed that some of the

recommended videos fell into a distinct category,

identified by YouTube by the tag “Recommended

for you”, as seen in Figure 4. A recommendation

that mean that the tag is used to signify tag

information more intensely personalized for a

certain user? To answer this question, the first step was to analyze and compare the

16
frequency in which the tag appeared in the recommended videos of each fan. By

running the analysis in song-related data (see Table 6), the results showed that in the
alternative music fan 8% of the videos that were recommended had the tag, while the

mainstream music fan had 18%. The analysis was significant at the 0.05 level with a

significance of p < .000. This difference is statistically significant [x°(1,
n=1870)=39941, p<.001).

Yet, the frequency of appearance alone cannot help us understand how those

tagged videos are related to the entire set of recommendations for each user. The next

step was to compare the popularity-age of those videos to the popularity-age of the

whole set of recommendations. In the alternative music fan (see Table 7), the minimum

value of popularity-age was 0.0000145660 and the maximum was 1.166508029 (M =

0.10, SD = 0.24). In the mainstream music fan (see Table 8), the minimum value of

popularity-age was 0.0020529470 and the maximum was 2186.223529 (M = 21.42, SD

= 167.91). Then the two means were compared by T-Test to examine if their difference

is statistically significant. As seen in Table 9 this difference, although large, is not
statistically important (p = .270).

Table 9: T-Test popularity of the “Recommended for you” songs

But are those values mirrored in the entire set of the recommended videos or are
they different? So, the next step was to compare those values of popularity with the
entire recommended datasets of each user (including the tagged videos). In the
mainstream music fan (Table 10), there was a mean of 6.41 (SD = 71.74). In the
alternative music fan (Table 11), there was a difference in all the values of popularity of
the videos. The minimum value was 0.0000008266 and the maximum value was
5.719632382 (M =0.07, SD = 0.25).

Then, once again, means were compared with the use of T-Test. The results in
Table 12 showed that the difference in the means is statistically significant at the 0.01
level (p = .007). From the results, what we conclude is that the recommendation
algorithms of YouTube, tends to use the tag in videos with higher values of popularity-
age, and that can be seen by the 14.1 difference in the means. In the alternative music
fan, the algorithm tends to use the tag in videos that were not in the edge of the
popularity -age value but close enough to the mean of this value, the difference is only

18
0.03, which could also be translated that the algorithm uses the tag in videos with higher
value of popularity-age. That is shown by the fact that the 76 videos with the tag have a
mean of 0.102 while the 932 videos have a mean of 0.079.

Table 12: T-Test popularity of all songs

3.4 Viewed vs Recommended videos

In order to examine the filter bubble assumption, it was considered necessary to
compare the videos that were recommended with the videos that were used to load both
users with content and construct the users’ profile in terms of musical taste.
Unfortunately, during the process of loading, the researcher did not manage to record
the information about the seconds since publication of the videos, so it was not possible
to compute the value of popularity for those songs; this is the reason why we will
compare only the views of the videos. The purpose of the analysis was twofold: first, to
examine whether more popular content is promoted, through the recommendations, to
the mainstream content fan; second, to examine whether the recommended content was
more popular compared to the content the two “users” consumed in the first place

(namely, the songs used to load the accounts).

For the alternative music fan (Table 13), the minimum number of views of a video (in
the dataset used to load the accounts) was 41 and the maximum was 500798 (M =
44284.84, SD = 71371.81). For the mainstream music fan (Table 14), the minimum
number of views (again in the dataset used to load the account) was 272211355 and the
maximum was 4725409580 (M = 784206748.9, SD = 640457467.5). The recommended
videos of the mainstream music fan (Table 15), had a minimum number of views of
138200 and a maximum number of views of 4683051115 (M = 332413196, SD =
561143147.7). The recommended videos of the alternative music fan (Table 16) had a
minimum number of views of 1 and a maximum number of views of 122051751 (M =
5315792.38, SD = 13157346.18). As noted above, we cannot provide a more accurate
analysis of this data as the seconds since publication of the video that were used for the

19
loading of the accounts was not obtained. Nevertheless, in the mainstream music fan,

there was a difference in the means of the videos that were used to load the account and

the recommended videos, but in both cases the number of views was more than

100000000. In the alternative music fan the difference in the means was also huge with

44284 .84 in the loaded videos and 5315792.38 of the recommended videos.

Table 16: Views of recommended

videos, alternative music fun

A T-Test analysis was also conducted, in order to examine if the difference in

the means was statistically significant. The first analysis (see Table 17) compared the

views of the videos that were used to load the alternative music fan with content and the

views from the videos that the user was recommended. Their difference is statistically

important at the .00 level with p < .001. Regarding the mainstream music fan (Table

18), the difference was once again statistically important in the .00 level with p < .001,

however the mean number of views was smaller in the recommendations dataset

compared to the viewed videos dataset. What we conclude from this analysis is that in

the case of the alternative music fan, the algorithm suggested videos with more views

on average, compared to the views of the videos that were used to load the user’s

20

 
account. This means that the user was suggested more popular content, in terms of
views, albeit still within the alternative music genre. Thus, it did not make it easier for
the user to encounter undiscovered or inconspicuous content. In the mainstream music
fan, the algorithm suggested videos with fewer views compared to the views of the
videos that were used to load the user’s account, on average. Yet, the mean number of

views was still significantly high (over 300 million views).

Table 18: T-Test mainstream user: loaded vs recommended videos

Another analysis that was conducted is related to diversity of the artists or bands,
namely the possibility that the recommended videos suggested more songs of the same
artists or opened up the user to more diverse content. A new variable, coded for the
sameness/uniqueness of the artists or music groups was created. The findings show,
quite surprisingly, that regarding the alternative music fan, only 5.6% of the
recommended videos were from artists that were used during the process of loading the
account with content. This suggests that recommendations steer the user towards
discovering new (for her/him) content. On the other hand, regarding the mainstream
music fan, 70.5% of the recommended videos were from artists that were used during
the process of loading the account with content. Here, this diversity is significantly

diminished.
3.5 The non-songs

The results, so far, show a clear profiling of the users, in both accounts. But to
go even deeper we conducted a qualitative analysis of the recommended videos that

were not music-related, to understand what the algorithms tried to “serve” the users. In

21
the alternative music fan, 68 videos (7%) could not be classified as mainstream or
alternative, so they were classified as non-music content. Of those 68 videos, five of
them had as main subject the coronavirus, and four were connected to the genre/taste of
the account (i.e. a deathcore song about the virus —and deathcore was classified as a
subgenre of alternative metal). Those videos were considered in the analysis as non-
songs because they were not created or recorded by an official studio or artist, but they
seemed to be made for fun. All the other videos were close to the culture of alternative
rock and metal, e.g. top 10 lists, interviews with artists, tutorials on how to scream,
headbang challenges etc. Fifteen of those videos (22%) were marked with the tag
“Recommended for you”. In the mainstream music fan, there were 62 videos (6%) that
were classified as non-music content. From those videos there were again some lists,
like top 10 songs of a specific artist or top 100 songs from the 2000s etc., while other
videos included content that was gossip about the life of mainstream artists, like Selena
Gomez and Justin Bieber. Moreover, there were videos from Disney’s productions, like
movies and series, and videos from talent shows like “The Voice”. Furthermore, 16 of
those 62 videos (26%) had the “Recommended for you” tag.

3.6 Non-songs & “Recommended for you”

On both users, non-music content that had the “Recommended for you” tag,
appeared more often than in the other videos of the dataset. So, we ran an analysis to
compare the non-music recommended videos with both mainstream and alternative
videos (Table 15). The results showed that the song videos had 245 videos (13%) with
the tag and 1625 videos (87%) without the tag, while in the non-music videos, 31 of the
videos (24%) had the tag and 99 of the videos (76%) had not. This difference is
significant at the .05 level [x°(1, n=2000)=11796, p<.001]. The results show that the
“Recommended for you” tag appears more often in non-music videos. When we
compared the non-music content of the two accounts (Table 16), it was the only result
that was not statistically significant [x7(1, n=130)=251, p=.616]. The platform of
YouTube does not provide only music videos but a variety of topics and kinds of
videos. The question here is: why would the algorithm suggest videos that are not songs
to a user that has been watching only songs on the platform? What is more, why are

videos not only recommended, by appearing at the recommended list, but also added a

22
tag, which can make the user feel more confident that the content of this video is

relevant to his/her preferences? Those questions cannot be answered from the current

analysis, but they could be used to trigger further research on the platform of YouTube,

with real users, so their behaviour could be examined regarding the recommended

videos.

4 Discussion and conclusion

The analysis that preceded focused on answering the research question of the present
thesis. But from the analysis of the data that was collected, more aspects of the
recommendation system of YouTube were examined, for example, the use of

YouTube’s recommendation system as a cultural algorithm.

First, as it is evident from the results, a filter bubble was created according to the
content that was used to load the accounts. In the mainstream music fan, the majority of
the videos that were recommended were classified as mainstream music, whereas in the
alternative account most recommended videos were classified as alternative music.
Thus, in this case we encounter a manifestation of the filter bubble phenomenon, based
on the cultural content recommended by the platform. As a result, a user that starts to
use the platform having a specific taste in music and over time seeks to use the platform
in order to widen her/his horizons in music, s/he is more likely to encounter content

very similar to his/her preexisting taste in music.

Second, in the case where alternative music videos were recommended in the
mainstream music fan, the popularity of those videos was close to the popularity of the
mainstream videos. This result leads to the conclusion that the views as well as
“freshness” of the videos are compatible with the entire set of recommendation,
irrespectively of the genre of the music. This means that even when alternative music
content makes it into the recommendations of YouTube to a user with mainstream
tastes, this content is highly likely to be already popular, in terms of views, as well as
“fresh” (recent). This renders unlikely that a user with mainstream music tastes
encounters diverse “undiscovered” cultural content, as there seems to be at work a
process of making more salient particular songs that are already popular, recent or both,
even within the alternative music genres.

The same goes for the alternative music fan: whenever a mainstream music
video appeared as recommended, the popularity of the video was similar to the
popularity of the alternative songs what were recommended. Compared to the
mainstream music fan, the popularity of the mainstream recommended videos in the
alternative music fan, was lower. The paradox of the analysis was that even the

recommended videos to the alternative music fan, that were categorized as mainstream,

24
had a popularity similar to the alternative recommended videos. In this case, a filter
bubble, this time according to the popularity of the videos, was created too.

The big difference between the two accounts lies in the videos that were not
music-related content. In the entire dataset, these videos appeared more often tagged as
“Recommended for you”, compared to the music videos. The analysis of those videos,
both qualitative and quantitative, leads us to the examination of a commercial filter
bubble. In the alternative account, the non-music videos were really close to the genre
of the content that was used to load the account, namely content that belonged to the
alternative rock and metal culture. On the other hand, in the mainstream account, the
recommended videos were highly commercial content originating from popular culture
products such as talent shows, videos about the lives of celebrities or parts from
Disney’s productions. The main difference here is that in the case of the alternative
account the non-music recommended videos can be seen as additional information that
reaffirms the user’s belonging to this kind of content and culture. On the other hand, in
the mainstream account, the recommended videos try to “pull” the user into other kind
of activities, outside music consumption, that are connected to mainstream culture, like

the productions of Disney.

Because of the diversity of content that is hosted in the platform of YouTube, we
examined Pariser’s (2011) idea of the filter bubble from different aspects and in all
cases it was verified that the recommendation were similar to the viewpoints that were
already held. To come to this result, it was necessary to examine and compare the
frequencies of the videos that were used to load the accounts with content to the
recommended videos of each user. The results showed that in the alternative music fan,
only 5.6% of the 1000 videos that were recommended was from the same artists that
were used during the loading process, which means that a filter bubble was not created
as far as the artists or bands are concerned. On the other hand, in the mainstream music
fan, 70.5% of the 1000 recommended videos were from artists that were used during the
process of loading. That high percentage of repetition of the same artists leads to the
conclusion that much of the content that was used to load the account was repeated, in
terms of individual artists or bands. Here, we observe the creation of a filter bubble, not

only in terms of the genre, but of the artists too.

25
In light of the results of this study, we now turn to consider anew the concept of
the “algorithmic culture”, introduced by Hallinan & Striphas (2017). We can argue that
the alternative music fan seems to have fallen victim of the “algorithmic governance”.
From the start, the recommendation algorithm suggested videos with more views and
popularity than the songs that were used in the procedure of loading the account. This
means that simulating the tastes and preferences of a user who prefers “fringe” bands
and artists, in the recommendations we encountered more popular and well-known
music videos, albeit still in the alternative music genre. Thus, artists with an already low
popularity in the YouTube platform are unlikely to see their videos in the recommended
lists of users (even users who actively select this kind of music). Because neither the
exact logic of the recommendation algorithm of YouTube nor the actual motives behind
it are known, we cannot explain why this is so. A plausible cause points to profit
maximization as the videos by artists from more official discography companies, or
from artists who already have a social influence and impact, are more likely to spend
money in order to promote their videos from YouTube to other social and mass media
in their attempt to increase their popularity. It works as a win-win situation for both
sides. The platform of YouTube gets more clicks, and the artists/companies gain more
fame.

But what if we look at the recommendation algorithm of YouTube as a
“technology of the self’, as discussed by Karakayali et al. (2018)? In their work they
argued about how the algorithms make a circle in order to recommend more
personalized content and engage the user to their content. The circle begins with the
algorithm tracking both the offline and online activities of the user. To develop this
discussion, we focused completely on the online activities of the users, because there
were not any offline activities, as the accounts were fake and were only used for this
specific research purpose. Thus, it appears that the algorithm used only one user action,
the history from the videos that the user had already viewed. The first set of
recommended videos appeared in the “Homepage”, where different videos appeared.
The fact that the user chose one of these recommended videos was the recursive
feedback of the data, which drove the user to the second set of recommended videos, the
ones that appeared in the right side of the webpage. From the choices the user made on
the second set of recommendation, the algorithm created an “objectified” aspect of the

user but was always ready to modify the user’s selections, which in this case occurred

26
the next day, where the cycle began once again. As a result of this, the recommendation
algorithm of YouTube can be considered as a technology of the self. This result can be
clearly seen if we analyze the separate days of the recommended videos. For example,
the second day in the mainstream account, the first suggested song was from an
alternative artist with high popularity. From the 100 recommended videos that we
collected, only 17 of them were from mainstream artists. This means that the algorithm
may have modified the user’s activity and did not disregard previous activities. More
important is the impact of the technologies of the self in the creation of a possible
identity, or in the case of this study, the creation of music taste of the users in order for
the algorithm to engage the users with content that serves the interests of the platform,
namely, steering the user toward specific videos to satisfy the goal of maximizing
profits within new media capitalism.

The filter bubble phenomenon has triggered the interest of the academic
community to examine its existence in different platforms, from different point of views
and different concepts. For example, Allen et al. (2017) examined real users and their
behaviour, in the platforms of “Pandora” and “last.fm” and the creation of a filter
bubble in the case of music. The results were similar to this thesis. A filter bubble
emerged to surface in the platforms, but in some cases the bubble was not created by the
algorithm but by the users’ activities, who were prone to create their own bubble, a
musical “safe zone” for them to consume their music taste, over and over again. Similar
studies took place in the YouTube platform examining the existence of an ideological
filter bubble this time. O'Callaghan et al. (2013, 2015) published about the creation of
an ideological filter bubble in the extreme right content and the creation of a pipeline.
The results showed that in a case a user consumes ideological right content is more
likely to be recommended extreme right content. Cross-checking those results with the
results of this thesis, some similarities were observed. For example, the mainstream
music fan was recommended videos with gossipy news about artists, or videos from
mainstream productions, like Disney. The user begun to consume mainstream music
content and then the recommendation systems began to suggest videos that are part of
the mainstream culture but not only from the music aspect. By replacing the alternative
videos with the LGBTQ+ YouTubers, it could be mean that truly, the recommendation
algorithms might underestimate their work in order to suggest more mainstream

YouTubers who could increase the profits of the business.

27
5 _ Limitations and suggestions for future research

As every research, the thesis had some limitations, as it was not possible to control all
factors. First and most important limitation of the research was that fake accounts were
used, which tried to mimic the behavior of a real user. So, the results cannot reflect on
the behavior of real users of the platforms, who are more likely to have a variety of
preferences in music and not restrict their choices to one particular genre, which in tum
would affect the construction of their profiles and hence their recommendations.
However, it was decided to proceed with the fake accounts and indeed construct them as
more or less extreme types of users in order to be able to simplify the number of
different variables that play some role in algorithmic filtering. One more limitation was
that we excluded a big part of the music culture, like different genres of music, such as
reggae or opera; on the other hand, however, such a limitation was necessary due to
time and resources. Furthermore, the categorization of the music into two rough
categories (mainstream and alternative) leaves out multiple shades of music genres in
between. It is important to mention that the loading of the accounts was made manually
by the researcher and needed a minimum of three hours per day. Moreover, more data
from the videos could have been gathered, especially in the process where the two
accounts were loaded with content. It would be important to gather information of those
videos that were not collected from the start, such as the channel and the seconds that
have passed since the publication of the song when it was first used for the purpose of

the research.

From the experience I gained through the entire process, I would suggest that
this kind of research takes place in an environment more specialized in music, like
“Spotify” or “last.fm”. It would also be interesting to conduct a similar algorithm audit
specifically of a service offered by the platform of YouTube, namely the YouTube
Music. The examination for different kinds of filter bubbles would also be interesting,
such as the creation of a filter bubble in the case of YouTubers. In their “About” page,
the creators of YouTube mention that “Our mission is to give everyone a voice and
show them the world”. It may be high time that researchers took a more active role in
showing how commercial recommendation algorithms, like YouTube’s, work and they

do not show us the world as it is, but only from the platform’s profitable point of view.
