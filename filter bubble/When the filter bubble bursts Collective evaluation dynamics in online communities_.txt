When the Filter Bubble Bursts:
Collective Evaluation Dynamics in Online Communities

Adiya Abisheva, David Garcia, Frank Schweitzer

Abstract

We analyze online collective evaluation processes through positive and negative votes
in various social media. We find two modes of collective evaluations that stem from the
existence of filter bubbles. Above a threshold of collective attention, negativity grows faster
with positivity, as a sign of the burst of a filter bubble when information reaches beyond the
local social context of a user. We analyze how collectively evaluated content can reach large
social contexts and create polarization, showing that emotions expressed through text play
a key role in collective evaluation processes.

1 Introduction

When the filter bubble bursts Rebecca Black, an amateur teenage singer, posted a music video!
on YouTube on February 10, 2011. The song originally circulated mostly among the Facebook friends of
its 13-year old singer and was loved and positively commented. Rebecca Black’s song received the "all
the usual friends things" [36] and was enough to please her, but it suddenly went viral in the wrong
direction. From initial 4,000 views on YouTube her song skyrocketed to 13 Million views. This sudden
popularity brought mostly negative attention, up to the point of becoming officially the most disliked
YouTube video”, and by June 15, 2011 the song received 3.2 Million dislikes in YouTube against less than
half a million likes. From local fame her song soared to the heights of global shame.

The anecdotal example of Rebecca Black’s song is paradigmatic of some aspects of the collective dynamics
of evaluations in online media. A video can become relatively popular within a small community and
receive initial positive evaluations, but when larger audiences are reached, negativity rises faster than
in early moments. Figure 1 shows this phenomenon through an example of the relative daily volume of
likes and dislikes of a YouTube video. Initially, the video is positively evaluated, but the volume of likes
decreases quickly. While initial dislikes also decrease, they start rising after the fourth day, reaching a
peak at the ninth day.

The early viewers of a YouTube video are prone to like it, either due to a social connection with the
uploader, or given the similarity of the video with their past liked content. This is a consequence of the

purpose of social filtering mechanisms and recommender systems, which is to personalize content selection
such that users find content that they consider relevant and of good quality. In contrast, the video can
also spread through other media towards more general users, and eventually reach a global audience with
users more critical or negative towards the video. Beyond YouTube videos, this phenomenon can be seen
as another aspect of the filter bubble [51]: The reinforcement of opinions caused by filtering mechanisms
creates an initial pocket of positivity, but when the filter bubble bursts, collective negativity can backlash.

Our study sets out to understand collective evaluation processes in various social media through likes
and dislikes, as manifestations of opinions towards the evaluated content. We test the duality of collective
evaluations in the local versus global behavior illustrated above, looking for the existence of a threshold
of positivity after which negative evaluations rise faster and polarization emerges.

Emotions in polarization Technological filters are not the only factor that shapes collective evalua-
tions; emotions influence cognitive information processing, shaping opinions and attitudes towards online
content. A number of studies in social psychology show how emotions influence individual evaluations,
judgements, and opinions [35, 24, 25], based on the theory of core affect [57]. Within this theoretical frame-
work, emotions are composed of two dimensions: i) valence, which characterizes the feeling of pleasure or
displeasure, and ii) arousal, which encompasses a feeling of activation or deactivation, and quantifies mo-
bilization and energy [57]. Additional dimensions can improve the representation of emotional experience,
such as potency or surprise [15], but their consistent inclusion in psychological research about opinions
is still to be explored.

Research in psychology on the role of emotions in evaluations show that arousal can lead to extreme
reactions and polarized responses [55]. The theory of misattribution explains this effect [76, 55] as a
transfer of residual emotions between events that intensifies the reaction to the second event. For instance,
men in a state of high emotional arousal {for example from physical exercises) give more extreme ratings
of attractiveness to women in comparison to the situation in which raters are in a calm emotional state.
Similarly, valence can be misattributed and bias evaluations [58], in particular when individuals inspecting
their current feelings, which might be caused by an incidental source rather than the evaluated content.

Further theoretical explanations for the role of emotions in evaluations pose the reduction of cognitive
complexity induced by emotional states, which bias the formulation of evaluations towards fast rather than
informed responses. The theory of affect priming explains this through the attribution of an individual’s

mood to similarly valenced signals in memory, which helps reducing the effort of evaluation tasks [29].
Empirical evidence shows that the subjective experience of arousal motivates evaluation on the extremes
[52]. For example, the ratings of famous figures by students are found to be more polarized right before
taking an exam, in comparison to weeks before or after. This kind of reactions are especially salient when
arousal is experienced along with negative valence (such as the stress before an exam), and thus we can
expect the expression of negative and aroused emotions to motivate more polarized collective evaluations
in social media. The digital traces of collective evaluations allow us to analyze further the role of emotions
in online evaluation processes.

Contributions of this article In this work we analyze collective evaluations across different social
media to reveal statistical regularities related to information filters and emotions. First, we test if the
distributions of likes and dislikes of evaluated content shows signs of the existence of multiplicative growth
processes of social interaction. Second, we test if the relationship between likes and dislikes is non-linear
with a division in to two different modes, corresponding to local and global collective evaluations. Third,
we test if the emotions expressed in the evaluated content lead to global and polarized collective responses.
Our work provides insights into the properties of collective evaluations and tests established psychology
theories on the role of emotions in opinion formation.

2 Background

Collective dynamics In the last years, lots of research focused on the topic of online communities,
ie. large groups of individuals that interact through an online medium. Collective phenomena such as
dynamics of trends [75, 70], or viral marketing [38] can be assessed with data from online communities.
Examples of studies on online user behaviour are understanding dynamics of replying activity and website
engagement of users [56], buyer activity in online shopping websites [37] and communication dynamics in
forums [30]. Another example is research on social influence, which was shown to exist in YouTube [12], in
Facebook [50], and in Twitter [69]. Furthermore, social influence on popularity of Facebook applications
has been shown to arise from a mixture of local and global signals [50]. While the former notion indicates
how friends and local community influence an individual’s behaviour, the latter suggests the effect of
the aggregate popularity of products or behaviours on an individual. Additionally, previous results for
popularity distributions show that the amount of votes for Digg stories [67] and tweets in trending topics
[6] follow log-normal distributions that are explained by social coupling.

Collective evaluations Online voting dynamics and dynamics of human appraisal were studied in a
number of previous research. Studies on collective evaluations mostly interrelates and finds explanations
in research on collective popularity of the online content, with the assumption that more likes lead to
item’s popularity. Despite the differences in the ways of measuring popularity, as a number of views in
YouTube [60], or as a number of likes and dislikes in Reddit [44], or as a number of votes in Digg [67|
or as a time span of trending topics in Twitter [6], these measures showed the existence of statistical
regularities of content popularity, and fit to the log-normal distribution.

Studies on collective dynamics of negative evaluations are scarcer, but some recent works illustrate that
social influence effects are present in movie ratings from imdb.com [41], and that controversiality expressed
through movie ratings evolves with time [5]. Additionally, herding effects have been observed in random
manipulations of votes in Reddit [73], which shows that the way users vote depends on the votes of other
users. Further research on Reddit [44] showed a non trivial dependency between likes and dislikes at the
collective level, in line with the questions we address in this article.

Online polarization The proliferation of online participatory media, such as social network sites,
blogs and online fora, increases users engagement in discussions on political and societal issues, which in its
turn may - under certain conditions - split individuals apart in their opinion space. Opinion polarization is
characterzied by a division of the population into a small number of fractions with high internal consensus
and sharp disagreement between them [14]. Agent-based models [40, 42] and experimental studies [68]
explain some aspects of opinion formation and its role in consensus and polarization.

Based on data from digital traces, previous research investigated polarization from the network perspective
in political blogs [3], in follower and mention links in Twitter [11], and in Swiss politicians profiles [19], as
well as in a non-political domains like friendship networks [26], and cultural expression [22]. Additionally,
exprerimental evidence shows that group processes like polarization function differently in computer-
mediated communication than in a face-to-face interaction [62], for example as the relative annonymity
of online media dampens inhibiting effects like the spiral of silence [48].

Online emotions Emotional expression through online text has been analyzed in earlier research on
data from MySpace [66], Yahoo answers [34], IRC channels [18], Wikipedia [28], BBC, Digg, YouTube and
Twitter [64]. Availability of large-scale quantitative datasets allows us to understand emotions and their
role in various domains. Studies in the field of subjective well-being leverage extensively on quantifying
emotions through text. For instance, subjective well-being is manifested in Facebook status updates [71],
and shows a pattern of assortativity in social networks [54] in relation to feelings of loneliness [7]. This is
in a close relation to the quantification of mood in Twitter which has been used to validate theories of
periodic mood oscillations [23].

Twitter mood measured in terms of valence and arousal reveals aspects of the relation between mood
states and online interaction and participation [9], and the psycholinguistic analysis of emotions reveal
the traces of mental health issues [10]. Furthermore, segregation patterns in geographical space [39] and
gender-based patterns [32, 66] can be partially attributed to differences in emotional expression. In online
interaction, for example in real-time chat conversations [18] and product reviews [21], emotions are not
a phenomenon characteristic to just an individual, but exhibit collective properties [59].

Lastly, information-centric role of online emotions has been studied through blogs [45], in Twitter [53],
and in Yahoo answers [34]. Emotions are the building blocks for a creation of social network structures
[74, 61] through empathy [31] that lead to correlations between emotional expression and popularity
[33, 63]. Negative emotional posts were shown to be drivers of communication among users and responsible
for extension of the lifetime of online discussions in forums [8]. Furthermore, the digital traces of emotions
synchronize with political outcomes [24], which goes inline with the findings that political discussions are
emotionally charged [27], in particular during election periods [20].

3 Data and Methods

3.1 Data on collective evaluations

Datasets The data used in this research is the result of our crawl of four publicly accessible online
communities.

YouTube (http://www. youtube.com/) is a video sharing website on which registered users can upload
and view videos, as well as post comments and rate videos with likes and dislikes. Our crawl? was launched
in June 2011 to daily collect a combination of top videos in various categories and to iteratively explore
the channels of general users [2], including 6.3 Million videos by February 2015.

Reddit (http://www.reddit.com) is a message board in which registered users submit posts with links
and text, and vote up and down for posts to appear on a frontpage. Conversations between users appear
in one of the many thematic boards, called subreddits, covering diverse topics from politics to science
fiction and adult content. From 2012 to 2014 our daily Reddit crawl* collected 338,000 submissions from
1,972 subreddits. While the user interface of Reddit provides fuzzed amounts of votes, it is possible to
construct the total amount of up and downvotes to a submission based on the JSON fields of reddit
score and like ratio. This way, we count with the text and the final amount of up and downvotes for each
submission in our dataset.

Imgur (http://www. imgur.org/) is an image hosting and sharing website where registered users upload,
rate, and discuss uploaded images. Image sharing traffic of Imgur has a large presence in Reddit such
that every 6th successful Reddit post has a link to an image on Imgur [49]. Our daily crawl? collected
200,000 images and their user activity statistics between December 2015 and January 2016.

Finally, Urban Dictionary (http://www.urbandictionary.com/) is an online crowdsourced platform
consisting of non-standard lexicon of slang words and idioms. Registered users can submit new terms and
provide definitions, and all users of the website, registered and anonymous, can vote up and down for the
best definitions. Between April and May 2013 our python-based crawl collected 220,000 definitions and
their votes.

All platforms provide functionality for users to evaluate uploaded content positively and negatively by
clicking an upvote/like or downvote/dislike button respectively. For simplicity, from now on we refer
to evaluated videos, submissions, images and definitions as items and we denote as likes and dislikes to
positive and negative evaluations, including up and down votes respectively.

Sentiment Analysis To quantify emotional expression, we applied sentiment analysis to headers
or titles of each item, leaving for a future research the analysis of longer descriptions, transcripts, and
comments. We applied sentiment analysis techniques to video descriptions in YouTube, image titles in
Imgur, submission headers in Reddit and term definitions in Urban Dictionary. Headers and titles area

good proxy of the emotional tone of a discussion, in line with earlier research on forum-like conversations
[24].

We measured emotional content of items by applying two complementary sentiment analysis methods.
First, we apply a lexicon of affective norms of valence V, arousal A and dominance D of nearly 14,000
English words [72]. In line with previous findings [72], the scores of valence and dominance in our dataset
are highly correlated, in comparison with the weaker correlation between valence and arousal as explained
more in detail in the Results section. This motivates our focus to only valence and arousal as suggested
by the theory of core affect.

Second, we apply the SentiStrength classifier [65, 64] a state-of-the-art lexicon-based method [34, 1] that
has been used in earlier research on the online data from MySpace [66], Yahoo! [34], IRC channels [18],
BBC, Digg, YouTube [64], Twitter [64, 53] and Wikipedia [28]. The core of the SentiStrength method
is to predict the sentiment of a text, based upon the occurrences of the words from a lexical corpora,
which contains the set of terms with known sentiment of a text. The classifier incorporates various rules,
which strengthen or weaken sentiments of the lexicon words detected in the short text. Among the rules
are syntactic rules, e.g. exclamation marks and punctuation, language modifiers and intensifiers, such
as negation and booster words, and spelling correction rules. The final sentiment score is composed of a
positive P and a negative N score for each text as two discrete values in the range of [+1, +5] and [—5, —1]
respectively. In our analysis, we normalize all emotions variables to [0..1] mapping P from [+1,+5] to
(0, 1] and reversing and rescaling N from [—1,—5] to (0, 1].

To ensure a valid measurement of sentiment and collective evaluations, we apply two filters to our datasets.
First, since both sentiment analysis techniques are designed only for English texts, we apply language
classification [47] and filter out all non-English texts. Second, we remove all items with less than a like
and a dislike, and that existed for less than a year in all platforms, to ensure that positive and negative
evaluations are stable. Detailed statistics on the number of posts in each dataset are shown in Table 1,
showing that they are still sufficient for large scale analyses. We will make these datasets available for
research purposes.

3.2 Statistical analysis methods

Distribution fits We apply a Maximum Likelihood criterion to fit the distributions of likes and
dislikes [4], to confirm early findings of the fits of the popularity distribution to the log-normal distribution

|67, 6]. We use the powerlaw python package to fit four statistical distributions related to complex growth
phenomena [46]: power law, log-normal, truncated power law and exponential distributions. We compare
the likelihood of each distribution using the log-likelihood ratio R = In(L,/L2) between the two candidate
distributions and its significance value p. Positive ratios indicate evidence for the first distribution, and
negative ratios for the second one. Instead of testing the hypothesis of the data following a certain
distribution, this comparative test answers the question of which parametric distribution provides the
best fit available, following the principle of Maximum Likelihood estimation [4]. To finally assess the
quality of the best fit, we measure the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between the best fitting distribution
and the emprical data.

Dual regime analysis We test the existence of a dual local versus global regime in collective evalua-
tions by analyzing the non-linear properties of the relationship between the amounts of likes and dislikes
for each item.

We use an extension of a traditional linear modelling, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS)
[17, 16] implemented in the R programming language package earth. MARS fits a continuous piecewise
regression function with knots that join locally linear pieces. In our analysis, we are interested to test a
dual pattern in the relationship between the number of likes L and the number of dislikes D, therefore
we set the number of knots to one and fit a model of the form

D(L) = I+ a, * max(0,L — L,) + ag x max{0,L, — L)

The values of likes above LE, and the values of dislikes above D(Z,) correspond to observations in the
global regime, after the bubble bursts, and the values in which any is below map to the local regime.

To evaluate the quality of the MARS model, we compare it to the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression
using the Generalized Cross-Validation prediction error (GCV) defined as

RSS

GCV = ——_
Nea ep

where N is the number of observations, RSS is the residual sum of squares, and ENP is the effective
number of parameters to avoid overfitting [16]. We use the implementation provided by the package boot
in R as well as the coefficient of determination R? of both OLS and MARS fits.

Emotion and polarization analysis Having identified the two regimes and their thresholds in the
relationship between the number of dislikes and the number of likes, we can mark items either in the global
or the local regime as a binary class. We test how emotions influence the chances of items reaching the
global regime through two logistic regression models, one for each sentiment analysis technique. Similarly,
we combine the values of likes and dislikes through their geometric mean to measure polarization, as
manifested by simultaneous large amounts of positive and negative evaluations. We regress this measure
of polarization through two linear models depending on the emotions expressed on the items.

Prior to modelling, we examine the normalized emotional dimensions for multicollinearity by computing
the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients, to avoid singularities. We assess the quality of fits in com-
parison to null models, by measuring the x? statistic of model likelihood ratio tests implemented in the
imtest R package.

4 Results

4.1 Stylized facts of evaluation distributions

Figure 2 shows the probability density functions of the distributions of the amount of likes and dislikes
for items in each of the four datasets. To understand the process that generates these distributions, we
fit a set of parametric distributions that provide insights into how likes and dislikes are given to items.
Following the categorization of [46], generative mechanisms produce stylized size distributions that can
be traced back to the properties of growth processes. If the appearance of likes and dislikes follows
an uncorrelated process and new evaluations are independent of previous ones, likes and dislikes should
follow exponential distributions. On the other hand, the presence of likes and dislikes can motivate further
evaluations through social effects, creating multiplicative growth {also known as preferential attachment
in the context of networks). In the presence of multiplicative growth, if items have similar lifespans,
likes and dislikes follow log-normai distributions. On the other hand if multiplicative growth is combined
with heterogeneous lifespans, likes and dislikes follow a power law distribution. This power law can be
corrected by adding an exponential cutoff if finite size effects limit the growth of likes and dislikes, a case
in which the distributions would be better fitted by a truncated power law.

good fits with extremely low Kolmogorov-Smirnov D statistics. The fits are not so good at the tails of
Reddit and Imgur, but the the Kolmogorov-Smirnov D statistic provide good values below 0.05 and the
log-normal distribution clearly outperforms all others. The worst fit is for the number of likes in Imgur,
for which Figure 2 suggests a bimodal pattern. Identifying the possible mechanisms that can produce such
bimodality goes beyond the scope of this research. We can conclude that the amounts of likes and dislikes
display a general heavy tailed behavior of log-normal distributions, lending evidence for the production
of evaluations following socially coupled growth processes with homogeneous life spans.

4.2 The dual pattern of collective evaluations

We explore the existence of a dual relationship between likes and dislikes through non-linear MARS fits,
testing if the relationship can be divided in a local and a global regime. We restrict the number of model
terms to have a single knot, measuring if a dual model outperforms a linear pattern. Figure 3 shows the
results of MARS fits between the logarithms of likes and dislikes. Vertical and horizontal lines mark the
likes cutoff value LE, and its corresponding value of dislikes in the fit D(Z,.). These cutoff values divide
the system in a local versus a global regime, with the fitted functions of the form D « L* and D « LY
respectively.

In all datasets, the exponent of the global regime is larger than exponent of the local one, for example
in YouTube y = 0.93 > A = 0.29. While both exponents are below 1 and indicate sublinear scaling, the
much higher value of the second one shows that, beyond a threshold value of likes, the dislikes given
to items grow faster than below the threshold as a sign of the burst of a filter bubble. The presence of
scaling in Reddit votes was previously reported in a smaller data subsample [44], concluding the existence
of superlinear scaling of dislikes with likes. Our analysis shows that the relationship between likes and
dislikes in Reddit is better approximated by a dual regime model, in line with the results of the other
three datasets.

We evaluate the goodness of the dual model against a single regime model in Table 3. The dual model
outperforms in R? and GCV to the single regime model, lending strong evidence to the existence of two
regimes. We further tested if additional knots could improve the fits, and found that a dual regime is the
optimal model for Urban Dictionary, YouTube, and Reddit, and only a 4 knot model could improve the

Imgur fit by a marginal GCV of less than 0.01.

Figure 4 illustrates the rank correlations between emotional dimensions. In all datasets valence and
dominance are highly correlated with p > 0.7°**, and therefore we discard the dominance variable from
regression analysis as it is difficult to distinguish from valence. Valence and positivity P have a minor pos-
itive significant correlation p € [0.2,0.3], and valence and negativity N have a slightly negative correlation
p = —0.3, illustrating the relation of emotion variables accross both valence/arousal and positive/negative

models.

level p < 0.05. Insignificant correlations are crossed out. Predictors are normalized to [0..1].
Dominance is highly correlated with valence, and therefore the dominance variable is discarded
from the further analysis.

We fit two regression models in which the probability of the event of an item reaching the global regime
G depends on the emotions expressed in the evaluated item. The first model uses V and A as explana-
tory variables, and focuses on the role of emotions as quantified through their pleasant /unpleasant and
active/calm dimensions. The second model takes P and N as predictors, and measures significance of
positive and negative sentiments in bringing an item to global regime. Table 4 reports the results of
logistic regression of the form logit(G) ~ V + A and logit(G) ~ P + N respectively. The role of arousal
is heterogeneous, having a significant positive effect in Urban Dictionary and Imgur, but a weak nega-
tive effect in YouTube and a non-significant one in Reddit. The effect of valence is also mixed, in Urban
Dictionary and YouTube the chances of reaching the global regime grow with valence, while in Reddit
and Imgur is the opposite case. The second model sheds more light to this: the pattern is the same
for positive sentiment, but negative sentiment increases the chance of reaching the global regime in all
datasets but Reddit, where the effect is not significant.

4.4 Analysis of emotions in polarization

Since the distributions of likes and dislikes are approximately log-normal, we can treat the logarithms
of likes In(L) and dislikes In(D) as centrally distributed around their means ([n(D)) and (In(L)). We
standardize the logarithmic counts In(D) and In(L) as:

_ _ In(D) = (in(D))
4u = sd(In(L)) 4p = sd(In(D))

where sd(In(L)) and sd{in(D)) are the standard deviations. Then, we compute a measure of polariza-
tion as the geometric mean of both values: Pol = \/Z, * Zp. This measure captures the principle that
polarization is high under simultaneous large amounts of positive and negative evaluations, and that
polarization is low when only one of the values is dominant.

To understand which kind of emotional content creates polarization, we fit two regression models as in
the previous section, one of polarization as a function of valence and arousal in the evaluated item, and
another as a function of positive and negative sentiment scores. The results of the fits are shown in
Table 5. In line with the theory that links arousal to more extreme opinions, we find a general pattern
in three datasets where arousal leads to higher levels of polarization. While there is no significant effect
in Reddit, all the other datasets show that items that contain words that transmit higher arousal also
create a stronger polarized response.

Table 5: The role of emotions in the polarization. Linear regression models, Pol ~ V + A
and Pol ~ P+N, results for polarization of the evaluation of an item as a function of emotions
expressed on its text. Arousal and negativity drive polarization in all datasets except Reddit.
The effect of valence and positivity is dataset-dependent.

This also manifests in the model using positive and negative scores, where negative content predicts
higher polarization in the same three cases as for arousal. The results of these two metrics are consistent
with the hypothesis that the expression of activating and negative feelings, such as anger or outrage,

 

12/20

tend to create more polarized responses, in line with the theoretical argument that poses emotions as
mechanisms to speed up evaluation processes at the expense of more extreme reactions.

Valence in evaluated items creates different responses. Two communities, Imgur and Reddit, show a
negative relation of polarization with valence and positive sentiment. The other two, Urban Dictionary
and YouTube, show the opposite, where polarization increases with valence. This suggests a context
dependent interpretation of positive expression, which does not necessarily motivate positive empathy
but can also fuel polarized responses. The positive and negative scores model works better than the valence
and arousal model in all cases but Reddit, where the valence and arousal model was more explanatory
for polarization, as evidenced by x? tests comparing both models.

5 Discussion

Our study of emotions focuses on understanding the role of emotions expressed in the text of items with
relation to the chances that the items reach the global regime and produce polarized evaluations. While
we used two established and validated sentiment analysis methods based on metrics from psychology,
future advanced techniques can reveal new patterns and potentially falsify the conclusions of our analysis
with current techniques. Furthermore, deeper analyses on individual data can correlate the expression
of individual emotions in the comments of a user and the evaluations given by the user, bridging closer
this way the measurement of emotional states and evaluations and providing a better understanding of
interpersonal emotions.

Following an observational approach to collective evaluations has the advantage of having high ecological
validity, but lacks the level of control that can be induced in experimental scenarios. We can deduce
insights on the factual properties of collective evaluations, such as the dual regime between likes and
dislikes, but testing the conditions that produce them requires a controlled set up. Our motivation and
explanation for the dual regime stems from the phenomenon of filter bubbles [51], but to fully understand
how these filters affect our behavior we need to experiment on how individual evaluations respond to
filtering mechanisms. While these experiments can be carried out it in typical psychological settings and
surveys, large platforms like Facebook can also experiment with the behavior of their users in this respect
(under the appropriate ethical considerations). A complete understanding of online evaluations can only
be achieved when our results are complemented by experimental approaches.

The use of observational data has the advantage of taking a natural exposure approach: we analyze the
evaluations of what people actually see, rather than the forced exposure to content in experiments [43].
In contrast, using digital traces of evaluations contains a selection bias by which some users might be
responsible for much larger amounts of likes and dislikes than other users. While this selection bias is
natural at the collective level, inferring conclusions about the behavior of individuals needs to consider
corrections and use richer datasets [13], or apply agent-based modelling approaches to connect the micro
and macro levels [59].

We explain the dual pattern between likes and dislikes as the result of filter bubbles, but other possible
explanations might also be plausible. Some unkown deleting mechanism might downsample videos with a
lot of dislikes in the local regime, or some external factor like audience size might explain the values of the
thresholds. The results of our statistical analyses of distributions of likes and dislikes fit to hypothetical

mechanisms of multiplicative growth, in line with previous findings on popularity metrics rather than
evaluations [67, 6]. Our in depth statistics also provide a clear view on the limits of our results, for exam-
ple in the worse fits of log-normal distributions in Imgur. Future research can conjecture on the possible
alternative explanations of our findings, in particular with respect to which filtering mechanisms are in
place. Our results do not allow us to distinguish social filtering, based on friends and follower links, from
recommender systems, which are based on previous evaluations of a user. Further research with informa-
tion on individual behavior can shed light on these different processes, for example measuring evaluation
tendencies to content produced by friends versus strangers, or across assortative and disassortative links
with respect to opinions.

Our analysis of the relation between likes and dislikes is based on the amounts given to items after a long
time has passed. This way, we evaluate items after they do not attract lots of attention and their counts
are stable. In a figurative way, we study the fossils of broken filter bubbles, but we do not study them
in a live setting. To fully understand the dynamics of collective evaluations, we need data with temporal
resolution on the counts of likes and dislikes. In general, such data is not publicly available on the sites,
which requires a much more powerful crawling approach to monitor items on a frequent basis, or access
to proprietary data.

6 Conclusions

Our analysis of collective evaluations across various online media shows statistical regularities in the
distributions of evaluations and their relationships. Our contribution is threefold: First we report that
the distributions of the amounts of likes and dislikes per item are well fitted by log-normal distributions,
a result that gives insights into the properties of the process that creates evaluations. Second, we test
the existence of a dual pattern in the relation between likes and dislikes, finding robust evidence of the
existence of a local and a global regime that is consistent with our hypotheses about the burst of filter
bubbles. Third, we found evidence for the role of emotions in the creation of polarization and the access to
the global regime, lending support for psychology theories about the role of affect, in particular arousal,
in the polarization of opinions.

Our results have implications for the design of online platforms and filtering mechanisms. Recommender
systems and filtering mechanisms allow users to discover content of relevance and quality, but can have
unintended consequences in the large scale. Our results suggest that the increasing polarization levels
of discussions might be created by these filtering mechanisms, and that users are at risk of receiving a
negative backlash to their content when it goes beyond their local social context. Such abrupt behavior
with respect to negative evaluations can have important consequences to user motivation and engagement,
which might only be visible on the long run.

Our findings shed light on fundamental polarization processes, in particular with respect to the role
of emotions. Increasing levels of polarization pose a risk of social conflict and hinder collaboration and
common goods, but a healthy society needs certain level of disagreement to be able to deliberate, discuss,
and take decisions about important topics. Calibrating the design of web and social media offers this way
the chance to find a balance between stagnation and polarization, leading to productive interaction in
our current online society.
