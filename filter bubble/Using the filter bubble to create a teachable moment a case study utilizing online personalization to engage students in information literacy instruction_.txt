Engaging students in information literacy instruction is often a challenge. The authors
discuss ways they adapted information literacy instruction at York College of Pennsylvania
based on concepts discussed in Eli Pariser’s book, The Filter Bubble. By approaching the
students with a course theme that was interesting, timely, and personally relevant, the
authors were able to break through student’s own filters to explore higher level
information literacy concepts and critical thinking. Students took a personal interest in the
topic, which translated into greater student engagement and increased participation. It
also fostered deeper reading and reflection about how information is communicated and

used by a variety of audiences. t

Introduction

For several years, Information Literacy 101 (IFL) was a 2-credit, required course at York College of
Pennsylvania. The course was officially dissolved in May of 2012. During the time period it was offered, student
response to the course was often mixed. While some students saw the value in the instruction, others felt that the

course was not relevant. Like many institutionally-mandated courses, faculty sometimes found engaging students to

be difficult. In the spring of 2012, the authors made a radical shift in their curriculum, hoping to improve the level of

student engagement and participation within their classes.

In previous semesters, the authors had based their instruction on the course’s electronic text
(library.ycp.edu/ifl), integrated with supplementary materials within the course-management system. In the fall 2011
semester, one of those supplementary items was a TED Talk video, “Beware Online Filter Bubbles,” with Eli Pariser
(2011a). The video was used as a springboard to prompt in-class discussion about bias and its effects. Based on
student responses to the video and their expressed interest in the topic of online personalization, we decided to try
using this concept as the theme for the entire class. Pariser’s book, The Filter Bubble (2011b), was chosen as a required

textbook for our sections of the course.

In The Filter Bubble, Pariser explains that materials perceived as relevant are allowed past the filter; messages
perceived as irrelevant are filtered out, not just by Google & Facebook, but by our human brains as well (Pariser,
2011b). In order for instruction to be truly effective, we have to penetrate our students’ filters, convincingly
demonstrating that strong information literacy skills are relevant to their daily lives. Pariser’s book served as an
anchor for course content, allowing us to connect our exploration of information literacy skills, tools, and methods
back to a larger theme—a theme that students were readily interested in because they have experienced “the filter
bubble” themselves.

The goal of this article is to present a novel way to teach information literacy skills by using the concept of
online personalization as a starting point for research and reflection on the nature of information, how information is
communicated, and how it is used. The chief benefit of this approach is that it addresses one of the major challenges
facing any teaching librarian who steps into a classroom: convincing students that the material being taught is
relevant to their lives. It also offers the librarian a starting point for teaching a variety of other concepts, including

(but certainly not limited to) evaluating information, researching current events, and information ethics.

Literature Review

As many authors have discussed, traditional information literacy instruction can often be challenging for
both students and instructional librarians (Drabinski, 2011; Piper & Tag, 2011; Spence, 2004). One widespread
difficulty is presenting materials in effective ways that promote student interest and engagement. Piper and Tag
(2011) explain that “there has been a growing disconnect between the instructor experience and the student
experience,” especially in terms of motivation (p. 322). Whilst librarians see the value in information literacy
instruction, students often enter instruction sessions expecting the sessions to be “dry, boring, and easy” (Piper &
Tag, 2011, p. 322; Spence, 2004). For a variety of reasons, librarians struggle to create classes that are “creative” and
“compelling” to students; instruction is often taught using texts and materials that, while informative, do not capture
student interest (Piper & Tag, 2011, p. 319).

Our own experience bears this out. Despite consistently high ratings regarding the instructor’s performance,
in course evaluations during the fall 2009 and 2010 semesters, only about 50% of students rated the course to be of
overall value to them. As a result of constant efforts to enhance instructional methods and course materials, by the
spring 2010 semester, the number of students rating the course to be of overall value had risen to 64.7%. Of the
students who did not rate the course to be of overall value, several students used the comments box to clarify that it
was “the subject itself, not the instructor” they were taking issue with. One of the most telling comments was that the
instructor does “as best she could with the information being taught. I like how she got outside sources of things we
covered in class to make the comparison.” Piper and Tag (2011) do concede that many librarians attempt to include
active learning in their information literacy instruction, but they stress that “without a thematic content that provides

intellectual challenge, these efforts do not solve the issue of student engagement” (p. 323).

The challenges librarians face due to time restraints have also been heavily explored in the literature.
Library instruction outside of a credit-information-literacy-course-environment often focuses on tools and mechanics
rather than activities which stimulate higher order thinking (Stevens & Campbell, 2008). Detmering and Johnson
(2011) argue that “we typically find ourselves addressing practical concerns related to finding sources or using
databases, rather than teaching students to think more critically about information and the information-seeking
process as a whole” (p. 103). These time restraints often prevent us from working with students to “conceptualize
research in a larger sense, as a process of critical thinking” (Detmering & Johnson, 2011, p. 103). Drabinski (2011)
emphasizes that library instruction often is taught “akairotically” —at the “wrong time, in the wrong context” and
with the wrong pedagogy (p. 82). Jacobson and Mark (2000) also worry about this, arguing “if students do not
immediately apply their information literacy skills to a content-based course assignment, they tend not to recognize
the relevance of such skills to other courses” (p. 261). This can lead to challenges when we want students to retain the

skills we teach and transfer those skills beyond a single instruction session.

One of the stumbling blocks for many students is that information literacy skills often have no context, thus
no personal relevance or value for them. Barry (2011) discusses the importance of creating a “real-world” experience
for students engaged in research. Leibiger (2011) points out that the traditional information literacy assignments and
instruction do not promote “natural learning.” The generic research paper assignment often “provides no context or
justification for the writing of the paper beyond the fulfilling of a course requirement” (Leibiger, 2011, p. 201). Thus
students see the assignment and time spent in the library as simply something needed “to attain a certain grade, pass
a certain course, or move beyond a certain semester in a student’s academic career” (Leibiger, 2011, p. 201). Since
there is no real-life relevance for the student to assign a personal value to, the experience becomes in essence a
“numbers game’ for both the student and the librarian,” where each are simply working to locate the number of
specified resources appropriate for the assignment (Leibiger, 2011, p. 201). As Chen and Lin (2011) point out, the role
of librarians and their approach to information literacy is constantly changing and we must adapt our roles in regard

to students, faculty, and institutions in order to provide “appropriate learning experiences” (p. 408).

Another struggle for librarians is finding ways to break through the grab-n-go information habits of
students. Leibiger (2011) refers to these habits as “googlitis” and describes it as “an over reliance on simplistic search
techniques using Internet search engines and the extension of these poor searching skills to the use of library
resources” (p. 188). Badke (2010) argues in his article, “How stupid is Google making us?”, that students do not take
the time to choose the best results but “rather choose the ‘good enough’ of picking from the first few results” (p. 51).
There may be a reason why students exhibit some of this behavior when they are doing online research. As Badke
(2010) and others have demonstrated, constant exposure to the digital environment has an effect on how the brain
processes information. Small and Vorgan (2008) have dubbed this effect “the iBrain.” In their investigations, Small
and Vorgan (2008) used MRI scans to map the active areas of the brain during Internet usage. In comparing the brain
function of novice Internet users with “digital natives,” the MRI images revealed that “the computer-savvy subjects
used a specific network in the left front part of the brain, known as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The Internet-
naive subjects showed minimal, if any, activation in this region” (Brain Changes, para. 1). The dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex plays an important role in our brains; it is used for quickly processing complex information and decision-
making in the working, or short term, memory areas of the brain (Small & Vorgan, 2008).

When comparing the two sets of subjects, they found visible changes in the novice Internet user’s brain after
only five hours of Internet use. They posit that these brain changes in response to Internet stimuli actually lead to

enhanced cognitive abilities, such as better attention to visual stimuli and faster decision-making. Specifically,

We develop a better ability to sift through large amounts of information rapidly and decide what's
important and what isn't—our mental filters basically learn how to shift into overdrive. In this
way, we are able to cope with the massive amounts of data appearing and disappearing on our
mental screens from moment to moment (Small & Vorgan, 2008, The New, Improved Brain?, para.

1).

Although it may be a perfectly natural way to deal with the onslaught of information online, the problem
with this adaptive response on the part of our brains is that it can get in the way of thoughtful, reflective decision-
making. The “iBrain” behavior essentially amounts to rapid filtering out of less-relevant content using almost
exclusively short-term memory. By contrast, when engaged in deep reading, it is the long-term memory areas of the
brain which are active (Small & Vorgan, 2008). The less we use these deep-thinking neural pathways, the weaker
those neural connections are likely to become. Flitting from link to link across the Internet can place stress on our
brains, diminish our ability to read deeply, and have serious implications for developing strong information literacy
skills. After all, it is the deep reading and the careful consideration of an author’s arguments and evidence that lead

to high-quality research projects.

One of the authors’ goals when choosing an actual book as a text for the class was an instinctive desire to
counter this grab-n-go approach to information. We hoped to encourage students to engage in sustained efforts at
deeper levels of thinking and reading. Plus, as Badke (2010) states, “there is a special pleasure that can come from
following a well-reasoned argument in a physical book” (p. 53).

Jacobs and Berg (2011) discuss the idea of “critical information literacy” as moving past simply locating and
evaluating sources to developing a deeper level of critical reflection. Jacobs and Berg (2011), describe “critical
information literacy” as “an attempt to help students see that information questions are deeply embedded within
cultural, social, political, and economic contexts” (p. 389). A key point in this concept is making the instruction
student-centered. Rather than librarians “depositing knowledge,” students become “critical co-investigators in the
problem-posing education of information literacy” (Jacobs & Berg, 2011, p. 390). Spence (2004) stresses that in order
for students to learn, they must “make changes in the generalized patterns that make up their knowledge of the
world” (p. 489).

Using The Filter Bubble in the Classroom

It was precisely these challenges that pushed the authors towards a radical shift in the information literacy
course at York College. While in the past we explored a variety of hands-on activities, ways to insert humor in our
instruction, and focused on current events in an attempt to improve student engagement, this was the first time the
authors approached the course with a consistent theme. We chose The Filter Bubble, by Eli Pariser as the required text
for the course, opting for a “textbook” that isn’t a textbook at all. The Filter Bubble is a book that is equally at home on
a leisure reading shelf, a computer science library, or in a media studies collection. Written for a general audience,
but containing a significant amount of research, it makes an excellent introduction to the concepts of web
personalization and its implications for society. Rather than ask students to read about (or lecture to them about)
information formats and retrieval tools, we asked them to read, discuss, and investigate one of their favorite tools: the

Internet.

In his book, The Filter Bubble, Eli Pariser explores the personalization of information online. Nearly all major
websites, from Google to The New York Times, use at least some personalization to drive the content displayed for a
particular user, and what is deemed “relevant” to one visitor may not appear at all for another. When asked in an

interview how much Google really knows about us, Pariser explains:

 

Vol. 1, No. 1 (Spring 2013) DOI 10.5195/palrap.2013.18 27

Using The Filter Bubble to Create a Teachable Moment

 

It knows everything I’ve searched for in the last few years, and probably how long I lingered
between searching for something and clicking the link. There are 57 signals that Google tracks
about each user, one engineer told me, even if you’re not logged in. (Popova, n.d., “How much

does Google really know about us,” para. 7)

The result of this personalization, Pariser argues, is that each of us is surrounded by a unique collection of
information online—our “filter bubble” — and the curators of that collection are mathematical algorithms that do not
necessarily have our best interests at heart (Pariser, 2011b). Pariser (2011b) points out three dynamics of the “filter
bubble” which make online filtering potentially damaging: users are “alone” in their “filter bubble,” it is invisible,
and users do not choose to enter the bubble themselves. When you combine short-circuiting of reflective thinking
processes—the iBrain effect—with the personalization of web search results, there is a very real potential for getting
stuck in what Pariser terms “The You Loop” —stuck inside your own self-reinforcing point of view, with little that is
truly new or outside of your interests (p. 109). This goes to the very core of information literacy: without exposure or
access to information and ideas, our decision-making process is hamstrung. Solutions to problems may lay just out of

sight— existing, but inaccessible, like a misshelved book.

In our classes, there was no use denying that the Internet was typically our students’ first choice for
information retrieval. We realized that like most students, they tend to view the internet as a “fast and reliable
answer provider” (Chen & Lin, 2011, p. 406). Rather than fighting this concept, we decided to use ideas in Eli
Pariser’s The Filter Bubble to allow our students to explore the web more fully. Together we became, as Jacobs and
Berg (2011) would describe, “critical co-investigators” (p. 390). We did not prevent our students from using Google.
Rather, we tried to allow them to learn and decide for themselves the limitations of web searching in the context of
personalization. As Leibiger (2011) points out, “the answer to the problem of Googlitis in higher education is not to
forbid the use of Google by students” (p. 211). After learning about personalization and seeing first hand in their own
lives how this was affecting their access to information, students were not only able to recognize the limitations of

web searching, they also were passionate about it.

Students were asked to keep a reflective journal online as they read the book. Their journal comments
revealed significant cognitive, and even emotional, engagement with the material. Many students acknowledged the
importance of learning about the issue and drew connections with their own experience or related it to another class.
A few students were downright offended to discover that a mathematical algorithm was making decisions on their
behalf without their knowledge. Interestingly, not all students view online personalization as a problem. However,
even those students who felt that online personalization is an inevitable and useful adaptation to the growth of

information online were, by and large, still interested in how it works.

Valuing Viewpoints

One of the easiest ways we were able to make the material immediately relevant to our students was by
bringing in Facebook as an example of web personalization. Since almost all of our students had Facebook accounts
and most checked those accounts several times daily, explaining how Facebook personalizes their newsfeed was
something our students could quickly understand and explore for themselves. Pariser (2011b) explains how Facebook
filters through your friends using “EdgeRank,” an algorithm that mathematically ranks your Facebook news feed
based on your relationship with the person the post is coming from, the type of content they are posting, and the
timeliness of the event. The results of this ranking can mean that friends whose opinions and ideas you value, but
perhaps do not click on as frequently, may be deemed less “relevant” and disappear from your news feed. In fact,
Pariser (2011b) explains, the disappearance of his politically conservative friends from his Facebook feed was one of

the catalysts that led to the writing of the book.

This was the first real breakthrough that we had with our students. In the past, having both sides of a
perspective might have only been viewed as part of a requirement for an argumentative paper assignment. Realizing
that Facebook was deciding to hide status updates of friends who did not share the same viewpoints as the students’
was a big deal. Students could immediately relate to it. They knew they had friends who never showed up in their
news feed, and they did not like that they were not in control of it. Suddenly, it was the students who were arguing
to us the merits of reading what someone has to say even if it does not fit exactly in line with their viewpoints.
Students even included in their end-of-the-course reflection statements such as “I firmly believe that to make an
educated decision about anything a person needs to consider both sides of an issue.” After students learned about

Facebook personalization we were easily able to enter into a discussion as a class about bias.

Confirmation Bias and Cognitive Dissonance

In chapter three of The Filter Bubble, Pariser (2011b) describes the concept of confirmation bias as “a tendency
to believe things that reinforce our existing views, to see what we want to see” (p. 86). Pariser explains in an
interview that the “filter bubble” is a “comfortable place,” a place filled with things we like and those things “that
most compel you to click,” but he also argues that the things we are compelled to impulsively click on such as “sex,
gossip, things that are highly personally relevant” do not equal the “set of things we need to know” (Popava, n.d.,
“What, exactly, is ‘the filter bubble’?,” para. 3). Furthermore if we are only ever being exposed to things that reaffirm
our belief system and make us comfortable, we are not able to really educate ourselves or engage in civil discourse.

With Facebook as a starting point it was much easier for students to grasp this idea.

Learning theories tell us that development occurs when the mind is forced to change in response to new
information which does not fit into its existing thought patterns. It is this cognitive dissonance or friction which acts
as a catalyst for learning, as the mind must reorder and reorganize what is “known.” Phelps (1990) posits a model of
the mind based on Piagetian learning. New information is either processed by assimilation into the mind’s existing
thought structures, or the mind accommodates the new information by revolutionary changes in thought structure.

This process is a balancing act, as the mind strives to create order and patterns. Phelps (1990) also tells us that

..development itself incorporates a negative principle in that its impulse to order must be
constantly defeated if growth is to occur. The internal principle for change is disequilibrium. In
order to be flexible and adaptive, our mental state must be always somewhat unfinished,

disorderly, with potential for new arrangements and novelty generally (p. 391).

Phelps (1990) also encourages us to exploit this tension between order and disorder in our classrooms. As teachers,
we should always be striving for ways to push our students out of their comfort zones, because that is where real
learning occurs: when we are confused, unsure, and out on a limb, our minds must stretch to accommodate new
ways of thinking.

However, as Phelps (1990) reminds us, development is not inevitable. Individuals may choose to reject new
information rather than make the mental adjustments necessary to assimilate and accommodate data that is
contradictory. When we see disengaged, bored students, or hear comments questioning the need for research
instruction, we are seeing this phenomenon in action. Stagnation of development is also one of Pariser’s (2011b) chief
complaints about online personalization, because both personal and algorithmic filters limit our ability to experience

new ideas and form new mental connections.

By exposing students to new information about online personalization, which they generally viewed as
both new and important, we created a moment of cognitive dissonance. Recognizing that there is something you do

not know is the first, essential step in the leaming process. Once we had their attention, our role as teachers became a

much easier task. The students were much more aware of the limits of searching on the Web and more interested in
refining their information literacy skills. In this approach, a class discussion of the limitations of online

personalization can be used to set the stage for a lesson on the mechanics of searching research databases.

Web Personalization vs. Relevancy Ranking

As discussed, our students were no different than the majority, with the typical “grab and go” approach to
searching. The results they most often chose were the first few results that appeared on a page. However, when we
started exploring web personalization, they were able to really analyze these results. As part of an in-class activity,
students were asked to examine their Google results, compare them with their classmates, and then hypothesize why
they thought particular results were showing up for them based on their personal viewpoints, likes, needs and
spending habits. In essence, students were learning about their own potential biases. Students were also asked to
examine the ads that were present on their first page of results. We discussed how closely personalization is tied in
with advertising. As Badke (2012) argues, “if a search engine can optimize the user's wants in the first four or five
results, it can both please the user and get the most relevant advertising into the user's view” (p. 48). Students noticed
that their ads on Facebook and other social networks directly tied in with their web browsing and that they often saw
ads on Facebook advertising a product that they had searched for on the web only moments before. Likewise, when
searching the web they were able to see advertisements that correlated with things they had mentioned or “liked” on
Facebook. These discussions prompted reflective thinking about the implication of exposure (or lack of exposure) to
information, such as this student comment: “Pariser brings up a good point when he says that Google puts us in our

own filter bubbles, alone. We don't make the choice to have our searches filter to something we would ‘rather see.’”

The authors also discussed how web personalization has affected students’ expectations for research both in
search engines, as well as databases. Based on the extent of personalization on the web, students now expect to get
results that are immediate and relevant to them wherever they search. We considered both the positive and negative
aspects of this and it allowed the instructors to easily segue into a discussion about relevancy ranking in academic
databases. As Badke (2012) points out “despite all the hopes of artificial intelligence and the semantic web, search
engines are still just finding words” (p. 49). Personalization can make researching on the web especially difficult
because Badke argues, it is “based on the assumption that what I was is what | will be” (Badke, 2012, p. 49).
However, each time a student embarks on a new research assignment they are essentially a new person and
venturing into “fresh territory that the machinations of personalization can't address” (Badke, 2012, p. 49). Despite
this, as much of the literature discusses, students still often use the same strategies in academic databases as they do
in search engines like Google (Badke, 2012). Academic databases have even started to cater to this type of searching,
offering a simple Google-esque search box in lieu of the multiple options in the advanced search screen. Badke (2012)
argues that many of the major databases “have advanced by leaps and bounds in tailoring search to what I ask for
instead of what the software thinks I want [but unlike search engines] proprietary databases are not dependent on
advertising to keep them going” (p. 48). This was a major point we brought up in our classes. We asked students to

carefully consider how information changes when it is being tailored to a potential audience of consumers.

Evaluating Sources and Using Rhetorical Analysis

Standard Three of Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Information Literacy Competency
Standards for Higher Education tells us that “the information literate student evaluates information and its sources
critically and incorporates selected information into his or her knowledge base and value system” (ACRL, 2000). In
practice, mastering these skills is often a major challenge for students. Achievement of Standard Three requires

comprehension, critical thinking, evaluation, and perhaps even a re-ordering of the students’ own mental maps.

Research into the development of students’ rhetorical inquiry skills offers librarians some potential explanations for
why students often have difficulty selecting and critically evaluating sources (Cooper, 1990; Phelps, 1990; Salabrici,
1999),

Salibrici (1999) indicates that “reading and writing should be ‘critical’ activities that push students beyond
the stage of comprehension and interpretation to a higher level of evaluation or critical consciousness . . .” (p. 628).
This overlap between literacy, rhetorical skills, and information literacy skills has important implications for teaching
librarians. Without sufficient comprehension, evaluation is nearly impossible. Without critical evaluation of sources
and their content, selecting appropriate information sources becomes a hit or miss activity for students. In advocating
for a rhetorical approach to information, Salibrici (1999) encourages teachers “to view language both in terms of

production and consumption,” as an interdependent relationship between authors and their audiences (p. 629).

Source evaluation is often taught using a checklist or a rubric, such as the CRAAP test (Meriam Library,
2010), or charts delineating the characteristics of scholarly and popular sources. However, there are some risks to this
approach, as it has the potential to discourage deeper engagement with the text. By focusing on discourse
conventions, which Cooper (1990) defines as “the rules that readers and writers must learn and use in order to be a
member of that community,” we risk encouraging an over-reliance on information format and surface features and
discourage the deeper evaluative skills we are trying to help students develop (p. 67). Burkholder (2010) warns us
against assuming that students are simply “lazy, opting for the path of least resistance by choosing Web sites over
journal articles” and instead considers the possibility that they may be “confused—or worse—unaware of the

rhetorical implications of their choices” (p. 1).

In order to help students look beyond surface features and engage in critical inquiry, the authors introduced
source evaluation not with a checklist but by using the rhetorical triangle as a framework for examining the contents
of a message. The rhetorical triangle allows us to graphically represent the interdependent relationships of a text. By
placing the author, the purpose, and the audience at the three points of the triangle, it becomes easy to see how the
elements function together to create a particular message aimed at a specific audience. If we introduce a change to
just one point of the triangle, for example, by replacing an academic author with a journalistic author, we are likely to
see a dramatic shift in the language, detail, and tone of the content. The concepts presented in The Filter Bubble work
particularly well using this rhetorical approach. Because the push toward personalization online is frequently driven
by profit, the topic lends itself to discussions of what constitutes authority and how to evaluate sources for accuracy,

evidence of bias, and ulterior motives.

Librarians are frequently asked to introduce students to the differences between scholarly and popular
literature, and the idea of online personalization can serve as useful way to begin the class session. Nearly all
students have some experience with advertisements following them across the web, and they quickly grasp the
notion that in the online environment, their likes and dislikes, click signals, and browser cookies are being used to
tailor content specifically for them, usually for the purpose of selling them something. Because students relate to the
experience of being sold something as a consumer, they are already familiar with the rhetorical conventions used
when an item is aimed at a popular audience. Asking them to diagram the rhetorical triangle for one of these
advertisements engages them actively in the lesson. At that point, the librarian can introduce a scholarly article, give
students several minutes to examine it, and then ask them to diagram the rhetorical triangle for the scholarly article.

This becomes a fun and simple way to introduce some of the differences between popular and scholarly rhetoric.

Conclusions

The authors wished that they had more time to continue exploring these concepts in a semester long course

environment. However, at the end of the spring 2012 semester the college retired the required information literacy

course, choosing to explore other curricular options for the freshman experience and orientation. Despite being only
able to explore “the filter bubble” as a theme in our instruction for one semester, we do feel that it was a success. In
past semesters, students responded to the course via formalized course reviews. As the authors noted, reviews had
always been mixed and some instructors even received comments essentially applauding the instructor as doing as
best as he/she could considering the material. Many students also commented about how they failed to see the
relevance of the course. Due to the discontinuation of the course past spring 2012 the authors were unable to have a
formal course review at the end of the spring 2012 semester. However, when we asked six different classes to reflect
on the course in their research journals, student responses were overwhelmingly positive. Students praised the

material, calling it “interesting,” “extremely relevant,” and “enlightening.” One student even added that the book
filled her “with more information than any class I had from kindergarten to high school in only the introduction.”
Others commented on how much they enjoyed reading the text, and some even encouraged friends and family who

were not in the course to read course materials as well.

and “concerning.” Even if they had noticed certain trends online, most of our students had not realized just how

Most students were quite surprised to learn about Web personalization. Several found it “scary,

ubiquitous that personalization is, or taken time to consider the implications of living in a filtered environment. The
authors also found the materials to be much more rewarding to teach and thoroughly enjoyed the sometimes heated
class discussions with heavy student participation. Students seemed to not only grasp the concepts but were able to

build on them. One student included in her course reflection:

We are fortunate enough to live in a country where we are allowed to have access to any media we
desire and therefore I feel by limiting ourselves to just what we like is not a good thing. It prevents
us from being informed citizens and if we are not informed citizens how can we participate in

democracy appropriately?

The authors feel that this course’s success is due largely in part to our students being able to connect the
information to something that was personally relevant and interesting. Drabinski (2011), in her thesis on Kairos in

library instruction, writes:

[T]eaching information skills at the right moment and in the right measure has the potential to
transform library instruction from a dull, standards-based, technical exercise in banking education
to a timely, contextualized, and highly-relevant classroom experience that equips students to

critically intervene in the discourses that surround them (p. 4).

The authors feel that by setting the stage with an accessible theme which was relevant, observable, and
encouraged self-discovery, we were able to slip in important information literacy skills that they might have not
understood, valued, or used in another context. In order to move past our students’ “filter bubbles,” instruction had

to first be personalized and interesting enough to get through them.

In terms of achieving our goals to increase participation and foster deeper reading and reflection, using The
Filter Bubble as the textbook was an unqualified success. Where previously the authors had struggled with methods
for encouraging students to complete the assigned course readings, it was clear from class discussions and journal
entries that most students were, in fact, reading the book. Information literacy instruction includes learning about the
purposes and characteristics of various types of publications. What better way to teach this than through actively

engaging in the reading of a complete book and combining it with explorations of other formats along the way?

In many ways teaching with The Filter Bubble has changed the way we approach instruction, and we are

constantly trying to think of ways to present information literacy concepts in a way that students can easily

understand, connect to, and find personally relevant. While the authors initially had the luxury of working within a
semester-long course, the reality is that most students experience library instruction through course-integrated
instruction or the simpler 50-minute, one-shot presentations. The time restrictions on these shorter sessions can make
it difficult to include deeper thinking activities. The authors are exploring ways to incorporate larger concepts into
smaller lessons. We are also exploring ways to collaborate with faculty to introduce some of these concepts and
materials to their students before the library session, giving us time to work more closely with the concept while in
the library. One benefit of Pariser’s The Filter Bubble is that it is extremely versatile and has sections that could be
easily tailored to instruction in a variety of subjects including English, Sociology, Communications, Psychology, and
Business, to name a few. For those interested in learning more, please visit the site we developed, Using “The Filter
Bubble” to Create a Teachable Moment (filterbubbleteachablemoment.wordpress.com), for additional ideas and more
specific lesson-planning materials. We also invite those with ideas to contribute them on the site. We believe that
online personalization and “the filter bubble effect” present an interesting, timely, and relevant opportunity to
creatively examine information literacy from another viewpoint and hope our explorations prompt further research

and reflection.
