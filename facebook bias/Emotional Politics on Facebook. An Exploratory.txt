Abstract 
The results of the European elections 2014 in Spain were characterized by the outstan ding rise of a new party, Podemos, which obtained five seats in the European Parliament,  despite being founded few months before the elections. The present study analyzes both  the content and the presence of emotions in Podemos’ discourse on Facebook during the  European electoral campaign. In particular, the affective content of both the party’s dis course and the comments of its followers will be analyzed through a pragmatic linguistic  approach applied to a corpus of 163 posts and 215 followers’ comments. Results show an  insistence on positive emotions in the party’s discourse and a prevalence of negative emo tions in the comments of the citizens.

INTRODUCTION 
The electoral campaign for the European Parliament Election in May 2014  found Spain in a multiple-crisis environment. In addition to the deep eco nomic crisis and the social tensions derived from the austerity policies, the  country was facing several political and institutional problems, such as the  Catalan independence movement or the many corruption scandals affect ing the central political parties. These circumstances, among others, led the  Spanish citizenry to develop strong attitudes of mistrust and cynicism against  political parties, politicians and politics itself, as shown by successive polls.1 
This political scenario witnessed the emergence of a new political force,  called Podemos, that was officially founded on January 16th, that is, four  months ahead the European elections. Its main leader, Pablo Iglesias Turrión,  PhD in Political Science and university professor, was a well-known political  analyst in different television shows. Indeed, his popularity and his constant  appearance in televised political debates helped him publicize his political  project during the months before the elections.  
Podemos was one of the new parties born before the European elections,  which were inheritors of the 15M Movement, as it was the case of Partido X.  All these parties made a massive use of the new communication channels  during the campaign. According to Sanjuan (2015), Podemos had a website  with detailed information on the European election and open to a partici 
patory process, a Facebook account with a growing number of followers  (149.000 during the campaign), an official Twitter account with 43.200 fol lowers at the time of the election (besides personal accounts of the party’s  leaders), more than 7.700 followers in its YouTube channel and an account  on Vimeo. Podemos presented itself as a party open to a participatory pro cess, formed by ordinary citizens who were disenchanted with the tradi tional political parties and willing to get involved in public life. Its intense

rise in popularity translated into 8% of the total votes and five seats in the  European Parliament.  
This study aims to analyze the party discourse on Facebook during the  European campaign 2014, focusing on the posts published on the party’s Fa cebook profile and paying special attention to the emotional content of both  the posts and the comments published by Podemos followers.2 
2. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 
2.1. Internet and electoral campaigns  
Political communication research has shown that electoral campaigns in  Western countries are undergoing a process of modernization, whose main  objective is to achieve the maximum level of electoral effectiveness through  a series of techniques imported from corporate marketing (Maarek, 2009)  and different refined ways of attracting media attention (Swanson and Man 
cini, 1996; Gibson and Römmele, 2007).  
Since the emergence of the Internet in the 90s, political parties have been  adapting themselves to the new tools provided by the Web 2.0 to the rhythm  of the technological innovations and the process of citizen appropriation, in  such a way that each election has been accompanied by numerous techno 
political innovations: blogs, video channels on YouTube, social networks, etc.  (Dader, 2009). Thus, while the Internet seemed to give parties a platform to  recover the political message (Bimber and Davis, 2003), i.e., to bypass the  media machinery and reach militants and voters through websites (Sey and  Castells, 2006; Chadwick, 2006), the Internet has been gradually incorporat 
ed as another element of the overall campaign strategy.  
Despite the technological optimism that accompanied the expansion of  the Internet, several studies about the partisan use of Internet generally sug gest that parties have used these tools as a forum to deploy their persuasive strategic discourse and attract media attention, rather than to recover a di 
2 This study has been realized under the research project Communication flows in processes of po litical mobilization: the media, blogs and opinion leaders (MEDIAFLOWS) (2014-2016), funded by  the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Ref. cso2013-43960-R). Its principal research er is Guillermo López, Professor of Journalism at the Department of Theory of Languages and Com munication at the University of Valencia.

rect link with voters (Norris, 2003),3 especially in the Spanish context (Dader,  2009; Dader et al., 2011). In this way, the accumulated experience seems  to confirm the normalization hypothesis, namely, the idea that the techno political practices of the Internet reproduce the main features of the offline  campaigns (Druckman, Kifer and Parkin, 2010; Schweitzer, 2009). In other  words, political actors are using the Internet mainly in order to foster mar keting purposes, not to stimulate political pedagogy or to promote debate  among citizens. But the political use of the Internet is not limited to electoral  processes. There is, in fact, an intense academic debate on the impact of digi tal communication on the form and practice of politics in Western democra cies. Scholars generally agree that the Internet has notably opened bottom up communication channels in political processes (Gibson and Römmele,  2007; Castells, 2009). More specifically, icts have been conceived as a tool  to face the growing citizen dissatisfaction towards democracy (Bentivegna,  2006), since social media allow for the direct contact between political ac tors and citizens and provide for new ways of political engagement. In that  sense, cyber-optimist scholars claim that the Internet has positive effects on  political participation (Lévy, 2004; Jenkins, 2008), especially intensifying the  participation of people already interested in politics (Dader, 2001, 2003) or  even reaching new groups (Rheingold, 2004). For their part, cyber-pessimists  highlight the resistance to change and democratization of political elites and  the lack of interest of the majority of the citizenry in politics (Davis, 2001;  Anduiza et al., 2010).  
2.2. Emotions in political discourse  
Political communication scholarship has primarily showed a formalist ap proach when analyzing online political discussions,4 since most researchers  have relied on normative notions of deliberation and operationalized its dif ferent conditions (Dahlgren, 2000; 2005; Camaj et al., 2009; Freelon, 2010;  Ruiz et al., 2010; Valera, 2012; 2014a).  
Over the last decades, several authors have emphasized that the study of  emotions may help understand social behavior and collective action processes.  
3 Among the exceptions, it is worth mentioning the innovative use of ict in some foreign campaigns,  such as those of Howard Dean (Sey et al., 2006; Jenkins, 2008; Dader, 2009), Ségolène Royal (Montero,  2009) and Barack Obama (Turiera-Puigbò, 2009).  
4 To the best of our knowledge, Graham (2010) is among the few scholars who have taken a tentative  to move beyond the formal notions of deliberation. His research analyzed the interaction between  deliberation and humor, emotional comments and acknowledgments.

According to Collins (1999), emotions bind society and motivate initiative in  social interaction.  
Different scholars point out the crucial role of emotions in constructing  the identity of social movements (Melucci, 1995; Goodwin, Jasper and Pol letta, 2001), since they play a key role in gathering people together, provid ing a sense of group identity and promoting collective action to achieve  specific purposes. This crucial role of emotions does not imply that social  movements’ members are simply irrationally driven or have no long-term  commitment to it. Even though the emotional energy is the primary attrac tor, there are people who internalize these emotions, and who are strongly  motivated and committed to the cause in rational terms. 
According to Collins (2001), the collective rituals that take place within  social movements generate two different emotional transformations. At the  time of the movement formation, emotions tend to be mostly negative, since  their members experience certain aspect of social life as deeply unfair and  therefore mobilize to design a plan for action. In fact, one of the means for  social movements to defy their enemies is the recreation of this initial vigor.  Then, however, the group generally transforms the negative feelings into pos itive emotions, which strengthen the sense of group identity and solidarity. 
This study constitutes an exploratory research into the presence of emo tions in electoral discourse through social media. We assume that emotions  were particularly important in Podemos’ discourse during the European elec tion campaign for different reasons. First, the party emerged a few months  before the elections with a strong heritage of different organizations, such  as the platform pah (Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca),5 or the 15M  Movement, etc. Second, researchers have pointed out the prevalence of per suasion and emotional appeals in the use of ict by political parties during  electoral campaigns.  
The research questions that guided this study are the following:  
• What kind of content prevails in Podemos’ political discourse on Face book? Does the party focus on ideological and programmatic stances  or does it rather insist on campaign issues? 
5 Platform of People Affected by Mortgages (Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca in Spanish) was  a citizens’ response to the generalized housing problems that emerged after the economic crisis and  the end of the construction bubble, when a lot of citizens lost their jobs and started to be unable to  pay their mortgages. Banks would then retain the house property and evict them from their homes.  Platform actions have been primarily directed to stopping evictions and trying to negotiate with the  banks alternative solutions.

• What kind of emotions does the party convey through its Facebook  profile? Do they harp on existing negative feelings such as mistrust and  cynicism towards traditional politics? Or does it run an online cam paign appealing to positive emotions such as enthusiasm and hope for  political change? 
• What are the emotional responses of the followers to the party’s dis course? Do the comments of the followers exhibit emotional involve ment?  
• Is there a relationship between the content of the posts and the emo tions conveyed by them? 
3. METHODOLOGY 
This study analyzes the discourse of Podemos and its followers on the  party’s Facebook profile during the European campaign 2014 through two  methodological approaches. First, content analysis is applied to all the posts  published during the campaign in order to assess what types of issues were  specially emphasized by Podemos. Second, the presence of emotions in both  the posts and the comments is analyzed through the means of a pragmatic  linguistic approach. 
3.1. Sample and time frame 
The corpus consists of all the posts published by Podemos in its Facebook  profile during the official time frame of the electoral campaign in Spain (9th to 23rd May 2014). These posts with all their respective comments were re trieved and saved by means of the research software NodeXLGraph.6 In total,  163 posts and 7578 comments were collected. The analysis focuses on all  the posts published by the party (n=163) and a sample of the comments. In  order to select the sample, five posts were randomly chosen (post number  7, 56, 80, 93 and 161) and all the corresponding comments (n=215) were  included in the analysis.

3.2. Content analysis 
The content of the posts was categorized according to the classification  scheme of electoral discourse proposed by López and adapted by Valera and  López (2014). It includes four possible categories: 
1. Ideological and programmatic issues: principles, values, ideological po sitions, policy proposals; 
2. Campaign issues: political polling, propaganda, election ads, campaign  events, debates, campaign strategies; 
3. Candidates’ character traits or personal issues; 
4. Government management (any information evaluating the perfor mance of a concrete government or official). 
Two raters classified the content of a sample of 50 posts (30% of the  sample). Inter-rater reliability was calculated using Cohen’s Kappa (k) statis tics to correct for chance agreement. The overall agreement was adequate  enough (k=0.62). As a consequence, the content rating was continued only  by one rater. 
In addition to this methodological design, we also analyzed the delibera tive nature of the posts published by Podemos, in order to observe if its  Facebook profile was actually being used for citizen deliberation. We did so  through a concept elaborated by Valera (2014b) named “political density” or  “deliberability”, which refers to discourse that contains any statement that  can be rationally debated. Generally, any post including an ideological or  programmatic statement can be rationally discussed and argued among us 
ers (see example 1), while other posts including information about electoral  events cannot (see example 2).

To assess the agreement among coders, inter-rater reliability was cal culated using Kappa (k). The results showed that raters were in moderate  agreement (k=0.52). Afterwards, the 42 posts in which raters disagreed were  jointly recoded and three major criteria for the subsequent coding of “delib erability” and “non-deliberability” were established.  
3.3. Linguistic analysis 
Regarding the study of emotions in political discourse, we propose a lin guistic approach. Generally, two different methods have been applied to the  linguistic study of emotions: sentiment analysis and pragmatic analysis. While  the first tries to extract emotions through the retrieval of affective words  (e.g. happy, sad, afraid, and so on) through different means (keyword spot ting, lexical affinity, statistical methods, etc.), pragmatic analysis studies emo tions in the context of a specific discourse.  
Indeed, pragmatic research considers that «emotional words are only  one way of grammatically codifying emotions in language» (Bazzanella,  2004). As a consequence, emotional language is always analyzed in the over all context of the discourse. Caffi and Janney (1994) identified six ranges of  emotional devices in language, which have been successfully applied to the  study of computer-mediated discourse (Laflen and Fiorenza, 2012; Vanderg riff, 2013).  
We chose a pragmatic approach for this exploratory study of emotions  in political discourse for multiple reasons. On the one hand, Facebook posts  are usually short, so the shortness may reduce the presence of explicit emo tional words. On the other hand, emotional content may be masked under  the metaphors commonly used in political discourse. As a consequence, in  the current study the presence of emotions in discourse is analyzed using  Caffi and Janney’s (1994) methodology, especially focusing on two types of  emotion markers: evaluation devices and proximity devices.9 
The first category is based on the central distinction between positive and  negative evaluations. It includes «all types of verbal and nonverbal choices  that suggest an inferable positive or negative evaluative stance on the part  of the speaker with respect to a topic, part of a topic, a partner, or partners  in discourse» (Caffi et al., 1994, p. 354). For example, a negative evaluation  device frequently repeated by Podemos is the term casta (caste), addressed  
9 Other devices mentioned by Caffi et al. (1994) are: specificity devices, evidentiality devices, volitional ity devices and quantity devices.

to the major Spanish political parties. The word casta (caste) is an emotional laden word negatively marked.  
Proximity devices are based on the central distinction between near and  far and include all types of linguistic choices that create a “distance” between  the speaker and the partners or topics (Caffi et al., 1994, p. 356). Among the  most frequent devices in this category the use of deixis can be mentioned  (personal pronouns, temporal markers, social proximity markers, etc.). Po 
demos made an attentive use of the first person plural pronouns (we, our).  The inclusive ‘we’ creates proximity with the interlocutor and involve him in  the political choices, a stratagem frequently used in political discourse (cfr.  for example Wilson, 1990). Indeed, the name of the party itself, Podemos,10 is  the first person plural of the verb poder (to can), which clearly echoes Ba 
rack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign slogan «yes, we can».  Therefore, the emotional content of the posts and the comments was  analyzed paying attention to both evaluation devices (emotional-laden lexi cal choices) and proximity devices (use of pronouns and deixis to create  proximity or distance with followers). The posts were analyzed indicating  whether they conveyed emotions (yes or no). Posts containing emotions  were subsequently classified according to the polarity of the emotions (posi tive, negative or both). To assess the agreement of the coders, inter-rater re liability was calculated using Kappa (k). The results showed that raters in  this study were in substantial agreement about the presence of emotions  in the posts (k=0.68) and in moderate agreement regarding the polarity of  the posts (k=0.48); due to the qualitative nature of the study, these results  were considered adequate and posts in which raters disagreed were jointly  recoded.  
4. RESULTS 
In general quantitative terms, Podemos’ Facebook use during the electoral  campaign showed a continued activity on the profile. The party posted 163  posts in a period of 14 days (average 11,64 posts per day) and received 7578  comments in total (average 46,49 comments per post).  
10 In the lexical analysis of our corpus, podemos was largely the more frequently mentioned word both  in the party’s posts and in the comments. These results are probably attributable not only to the  repetition of the name of the party, but also to the frequency of the modal verb poder (to can).

leaders. This shows that despite the strong leadership and great visibility of  its main leader, Pablo Iglesias Turrión, Podemos avoided to run a campaign  based on this leadership in social media. It rather deployed a grass roots elec 
toral strategy trying to appeal to and mobilize the ordinary citizen.  Finally, just 1% of the posts consisted on a critique to the management  of the incumbent government. This result seems particularly striking, since  most of Podemos’ public discourse has consisted on a fierce and well-jus tified critique to the traditional political parties and their management on  different levels of government. However, the results suggest that this rather  negative strategy was substituted by a more constructive discourse during  the campaign, as the analysis of emotions will point out later on.  Moreover, the analysis of the political density shows that the posts pre sented slight more “non-deliberability”. Table 1 reveals that, in fact, 52% of  the posts (84 posts out of 163) did not contain any statement that could  be rationally discussed among the followers, but were centered on specific  campaign information.  
Table 1 
Political density of the posts 
Absolute frequency Relative frequency  
Deliberable posts 79 48% Non-deliberable posts 84 52% 
In other words, more than half of the posts published by Podemos dur ing the campaign did not contain any statement that could translate into a  substantial deliberation among the followers. Instead of promoting citizen  discursive interaction, most of the content was designed to publish cam paign information, such as concrete campaign events taking place all around  the Spanish territory, or different ways to contribute to the party’s funding.  Still, 48% of the posts did imply taking stances that could be debated among  citizens.

That is, the party’s discourse during the campaign was characterized by  a significant positive tone, as suggested previously by the content analysis.  Moreover, 21% of Podemos’ publications included both positive and negative  emotions (Figure 2). 
4.3. Relationship between topic and emotions 
In addition to the analysis of the presence of emotions, we asked ourselves  about the possible relationship between the type of content published by  the party and the presence of emotions. That is, were certain types of con tent more likely to contain emotions? 
Table 3 
Presence of emotions in different types of content (absolute values) 
Type of content/ Presence of emotions No emotions Emotions Total  Ideological/ Programmatic 9 44 53 Campaign 51 53 104 Candidates 2 3 5 Government management 0 1 1 Total 62 101 163 
As showed in Table 3, ideological and programmatic posts were far more  likely to include emotional content in comparison to posts related to cam paign issues. Indeed, ideological and programmatic posts conveyed emotions  more frequently: 44 out 53 posts (83%) included affective content.11 The as sociation of ideological and programmatic issues with the presence of emo tions constitutes an interesting result, showing that the party exposed its  essential ideological stances and programmatic proposals with the help of  emotional devices in order to mobilize the citizenry. 
11 Due to the small sample size, no further statistical tests were calculated to analyze the association  between the two variables.

4.4 The presence of emotions in the comments 
Before analyzing the emotional content of the comments, it is worth con sidering some basic information about the posts that were randomly select ed for analyzing their comments, as their content and emotional value may  influence the subsequent comments (Table 4).  
Table 4 
Posts randomly selected for the analysis of their comments 
Post Type of content «Deliberability» Presence  of emotions

issues 
Yes Yes Positive 
80 Campaign issues No Yes Positive 
93 Ideological and  programmatic  
issues 
Yes Yes Both 
161 Campaign issues No Yes Negative 
The results of the analysis of the 215 comments clearly show a very dif ferent pattern in comparison with the posts published by the party (Table  5). Most of the comments contained no emotional content at all (154 out of  215), even though programmatic issues were debated, the hope for a political  change repeated in the posts related to campaign issues and posts showed  different emotional polarity. Most of the users only commented once, and  no real debates took place among several users, although two of the posts  randomly chosen showed political density, thus theoretically opening the  way to citizens’ debates. Only less than one third (61 out of 215) expressed  some emotion (Table 5). That is, the party deployed a much more emotional  discourse in this social network than the citizens that got involved in the  online political discussions. 
  

Agnese Sampietro and Lidia Valera Ordaz Emotional Politics on Facebook. An Exploratory Study of Podemos 77 
In general, the expression of negative emotions in the comments by Po demos’ followers refers to feelings of mistrust, cynicism and disaffection to wards political elites. These negative comments, as previously exposed, are  the most common, according to our results. For example, the 6th comment  of post number 7 (example 3), shows a negative orientation towards politi cians: 
(3) You know, what bothers me is that we are people who have very clear ideas and when  they try to deceive us, they think we’re stupid and we believe everything they say without  consequences, that then we will not remember anything. But that is over, we are not sheep  following the herd [...]12. 
In contrast, positive emotional comments refer to feelings like enthusiasm  and hope and they tend to be addressed to Podemos as a party and its poten tial to promote a political and social change in Spain. For example, the 32nd comment of post number 80 clearly shows a positive orientation towards  the party and its campaign, as shown in example 4: 
(4) Today the act in Alicante was fantastic. The thrill of feeling the people get together.  More than numbers, I would talk about authenticity, and in Podemos’ acts you can breathe  genuine enthusiasm and excitement; it’s moving to see so many people together believing  in the same project13. 
5. CONCLUSIONS 
The last two decades have witnessed an increasing interest of scholars in  the use of the Internet in different political participation and mobilization  processes. The growth and success of social networks have recently moved  academic attention to these new communication platforms. In this article,  we have analyzed Podemos’ use of Facebook during the European election  campaign, as well as the relationship between emotions and political dis course.  
According to the content analysis, campaign issues clearly prevailed in  the party’s discourse on Facebook (such as information about multiple cam

13 «Tremendo hoy el acto de Alicante. La emoción de sentir que el pueblo se une. Más que de números,  yo hablaría de autenticidad, y en los actos de Podemos se respira auténtica ilusión y emoción de ver  a tanta gente junta creyendo en un mismo proyecto […]».

paign events, or about different ways to financially support the party), while  ideological and programmatic-laden contents were less frequent. This con firms that Podemos’ use of the Internet was electorally driven, since they  mainly used it as a tool to deploy their persuasive-strategic discourse, instead  of trying to recover a direct link with voters or promote citizen deliberation  (Dader et al., 2011). In that sense, our results with regards to the topics and  the limited “deliberability” (Valera, 2014b) of the posts contribute to ratify  the normalization hypothesis (Schweitzer, 2009; Druckman et al., 2010).  
Despite the formal bias of political communication research when deal ing with online political discussions, this study presents an exploratory re search of the presence of emotions on the party’s discourse. Emotions are  considered important in the emergence and strengthening of political and  social movements (Collins, 2001), such as the 15M Movement (Belli and Díez,  2013), the Obama’s campaign 2008 (Castells, 2009), or the MAS movement in  Bolivia (Errejón, 2012).  
Following a pragmatic linguistic approach, this research has shown a sig nificant presence of emotions in Podemos’ discourse on Facebook. These  emotions were mainly positive during the campaign, since the party repeat edly appealed to feelings like enthusiasm and hope for a political change to  promote mobilization. These results are in big contrast with Podemos’ public  discourse before the campaign, which consisted on a well-justified and sys tematic critique of the traditional Spanish political parties.  
Moreover, our results reveal that ideological and programmatic posts were  more likely to contain emotions, thus confirming the idea that emotions play  an important role in processes of political and social mobilization, especially  in the early stages of the building of a new political and social movement  (Collins, 2001). But there were also some negative emotions found in Pode 
mos’ discourse, mainly associated to Spanish traditional political parties. That  is, Podemos’ discourse during the campaign 2014 was consistently presented  with an emotional tone, mainly positive (hope for a change and confidence  on the party) but also negative (critiques and attacks against the “caste”).  
According to the analysis of emotions in the development of social move ments elaborated by Collins (2001), movements start from negative feelings  against people, institutions or organizations that threaten their main values,  and then they move to more positive feelings, such as pride or hope. The  negative emotions of the 15M Movement were addressed to traditional polit ical actors and institutions, which were considered corrupted, degraded and  inadequate to solve social problems. In that sense, our analysis of emotions in

both the party’s discourse and the comments shows a very interesting result  and a marked discrepancy.  
On the one hand, the results suggest that Podemos tried to convert these  first negative emotions against traditional parties into positive feelings dur ing the campaign, placing itself in the political scenario as a source of hope  and change, as argued by Collins (2001) in his conception of the two emo tional stages of social movements.  
On the other hand, just a minority of followers’ comments had some  emotional content and most of them showed a lack of political density.  In their majority posts were simple repetitions of campaign slogans, or  questions about practical campaign issues, and citizens rarely involved in  real political debates. Moreover, emotionally laden comments mainly con 
veyed expressions of negative emotions, such as mistrust or cynicism, in  stark contrast with the party’s predominant positive emotional tone. It is  therefore reasonable to assume that the party’s support and its surprising  electoral mobilization were achieved through the negative motivations of  its followers. In other words, while the party was already trying to move to  a more positive discourse that could transform the citizen disenchantment  into social change, the electoral base of the party remained mainly at an  earlier stage, expressing negative feelings against traditional political actors  and politics in general.  
In conclusion, this study constitutes a first attempt to analyze the pres ence of emotions in political discourse through social networks. Due to the  exploratory nature of the study, several limitations should be noted. First,  the qualitative nature of the method used to identify emotions hinders a  generalization of the results. Even though inter-rater reliability was statisti cally calculated and considered adequate, a subjective bias in the analysis  of the data remains. Another limitation refers to the size of the sample,  especially in the case of the comments, which impose a prudent discus sion of the results. Future research with bigger samples of comments will  have to establish if these results are generalizable. Finally, future research  will also have to study the presence of emotions in political discourse in  non-electoral periods. Comparative studies could also analyze the emo tional dimension of multiple parties’ discourse. Moreover, the deliberative  dimension of online political discussions could also be considered in more  detail, through a more extensive analysis of followers’ interactions and  participation.
