Optimistic Bias and Facebook Use: 
Self–Other Discrepancies About Potential Risks 
and Benefits of Facebook Use

Despite the accumulating evidence on the positive and negative outcomes of Facebook use, how people  
perceive themselves to be subject to these outcomes as well as the consequences and mechanisms of these

growing volume of research reports possible benefits of using social media, such as increased social capital,1 an enhanced sense of well-being2 and social and emotional support,3,4 and decreased depressive symptoms.5 A number of studies also report negative outcomes associated with social media use, such as decreased self-esteem and happiness,6 increased psychological distress,7 a sense of social isolation and jeal ousy,5,8 conflict among romantic partners,9,10 and being victimized by cyberbullying.11,12 
Despite a rapidly growing body of evidence on the mixed outcomes of Facebook use, very little is known about how people perceive themselves to be subject to these negative or positive outcomes of using Facebook. The literature on self perceptions posits that people possess an innate tendency to view their future as more positive and rosier than that of 
while good things are more likely to happen to me than to others.’’(13p807) 
This framework has been applied to an array of different contexts, including to what extent frequent exposure to news induces or reduces optimistic biases for critical events,14 and how people operate optimistic biases toward online threats.15 The optimistic biases were also found to influence subse quent health behaviors. For example, optimistic biases measured after viewing antismoking messages were associ ated with an increase in smokers’ information-seeking be haviors,16 and people’s optimistic biases regarding their health conditions can be associated with delays in adopting positive health behaviors.17 
This optimistic bias framework can be used to understand people’s perceptions of encountering potential risks and benefits from Facebook use. According to the predictions of optimistic bias, people have an intrinsic tendency to imagine

future events in a manner that enhances positive self regard,18,19 which leads people to underestimate their vulner ability to negative events.13 When Facebook users operate optimistic biases in their risk judgments, they should perceive detrimental outcomes of Facebook, such as ex periencing depression or loneliness and becoming a victim of a scam, to be more likely to happen to others than to themselves. 
Furthermore, if Facebook users believe that other people are more likely to experience negative outcomes of Face book, this perception may trigger the importance of having protective actions, such as Internet regulations and media literacy education to reduce the potential harm to others. Similar to the third-person effect that has often been con nected to the optimistic bias framework,20 the perceived negative media effects on others stimulate support for protective actions. As such, this study investigates a po tential link between optimistic bias and one’s willingness to support protective actions with respect to negative Face book outcomes.

Similarly, people’s beliefs about their chances of experi encing a positive Facebook outcome should be contingent upon their personal involvement with Facebook. Because people construct perceptions through social practices over time, Facebook users who rarely use Facebook may not view seemingly positive outcomes of Facebook as valuable ben efits. When individuals infrequently use a medium, they are unlikely to expect any outcomes of media use, even if they are positive. Thus, lack of personal involvement with Face book should yield a reversed optimistic bias that others will be more likely to encounter positive outcomes on Facebook. Based on the predictions addressed above, the following hypotheses are proposed: 
H1: Facebook users will perceive other users to be more likely to experience negative social and psychological out comes of Facebook use relative to themselves. 
H2: Optimistic bias for (a) negative social outcomes and (b) negative psychological outcomes will increase support for protective actions. 
H3a: When individuals have negative pre-existing attitudes toward Facebook’s influence, they will estimate that other users are more likely to experience positive outcomes from Facebook use relative to themselves. 
H3b: When individuals have low involvement in Facebook, they will believe that other users are more likely to expe rience positive outcomes from Facebook use relative to themselves. 
Method 
Participants and procedure 
A total of 237 participants between 18 and 37 years of age (M = 20.4 years, SD = 1.95 years) at a university in the northeastern United States who use Facebook on a daily basis participated in the study in exchange for extra credit. Once participants agreed upon the informed consent form, they were directed to an external web-server hosting the online survey. 
In assessing optimistic bias, the indirect method was used whereby participants made two assessments including one’s own likelihood of experiencing positive and negative Face book outcomes and other people’s likelihood of experiencing them. By subtracting the latter from the former judgment, a differential score was calculated for each outcome. The order of measures for self-estimation versus those for other estimation was counterbalanced.26 This indirect method, measuring comparative judgment of the self versus the other is a widely used approach to gauge optimistic bias18 when it is difficult or impossible to estimate the actual likelihood of a future event.27–29 Participants were also asked to rate their likelihood of supporting protective actions (e.g., Internet regulations), personal Facebook involvement, and attitudes toward Facebook use prior to answering demographic questions. 
Measures 
Optimistic biases for negative outcomes, including nega tive effects on psychological well-being and social conse quences, were measured by eight items on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = ‘‘strongly disagree’’ to 7 = ‘‘strongly agree’’). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the likelihood of experiencing negative outcomes revealed two factors: the negative psychological outcomes and the negative social outcomes (Table 1). The estimation of their own chances of experiencing negative psychological outcomes was labeled as the negative psychological outcomes for self scale (Cronbach’s a = 0.93), and the estimation of other people’s chances of experiencing those items formed the negative psychological outcomes for others scale (Cronbach’s a = 0.88). The estimation of their own probability of expe riencing negative social outcomes was scaled and labeled as the negative social outcomes for self scale (Cronbach’s a = 0.73). The corresponding items estimating other users’ chances were labeled as the negative social outcomes for others scale (Cronbach’s a = 0.76). 
Support for protective actions regarding Facebook use was measured by four items, such as ‘‘the government’s tech nology policies should state the consequences of misconduct on social media Web sites,’’ on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = ‘‘strongly disagree’’ to 7 = ‘‘strongly agree.’’ The

Results 
Optimistic bias and negative Facebook outcomes 
Paired-sample t tests revealed that participants displayed a strong optimistic bias, believing that they are less likely than others are to experience negative psychological outcomes (self: M = 2.79, SD = 1.41; others: M = 3.83, SD = 1.14), t(236) = - 13.79, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = - 0.91, and negative social outcomes (self: M = 3.18, SD = 1.21; others: M = 4.41, SD = 1.02), t(236) = - 18.00, p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = - 1.18 (Table 1). Thus, H1 was supported. 
A series of mediation analyses33,34 were conducted to test H2a and H2b. Optimistic bias of other people’s chances of experiencing negative social outcomes (e.g., being the target of Facebook scams) mediated the relationship between op timistic self-views on avoiding negative social outcomes and 
support for protective actions (Fig. 1). A Sobel test and ad ditional bootstrap analysis with 1,000 resamples, reporting point estimates and bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals (CI) for effect size inferences, confirmed this mediation re lationship (z = 2.49, p = 0.01, point estimate = 0.113 [95% CI = 0.011, 0.216]). Thus, H2a was fully supported. For op timistic biases for psychological outcomes tested in H2b (Fig. 1), mediation analyses followed by a Sobel test with bootstrapping (1,000 resamples) showed that the perception of other Facebook users’ chances of experiencing negative psychological outcomes did not mediate the relationship between one’s own optimistic views and support for pro tective actions (z = 1.25, p = 0.21; point estimate = 0.053 [95% CI = - 0.050, 0.149]). Thus, H2b was not supported. 
Optimistic bias and positive outcomes 
Note that the preliminary analyses reported that the opti mistic bias for positive outcomes of Facebook use was re versed, perceiving other Facebook users to be more likely to experience positive outcomes of Facebook than themselves, t(236) = - 5.52, p < 0.01, Cohen’s d = - 0.37. H3a and H3b were developed to examine the reversed optimistic biases by taking participants’ attitudes toward Facebook use and Fa cebook involvement into account. Following Cho et al.,15 the attitudes toward Facebook use scale was dichotomized based on its median point, and entered into a mixed general linear model (GLM) as a moderating factor. There was a significant interaction between optimistic bias and attitudes, F(1, 235) = 7.45, p = 0.007, gp2 = 0.03, indicating that participants who perceived the influence of Facebook to be undesirable tended to perceive that other people were more likely to experience positive outcomes of Facebook than themselves (Fig. 2). Thus, H3a was supported. 
In order to test H3b, the Facebook involvement scale was dichotomized by its median point into two groups: a high Facebook involvement group and a moderate Facebook in volvement group. Those with high Facebook involvement estimated a greater likelihood of experiencing positive

book, it is not clear how Facebook users perceive themselves to be likely to experience these potential risks and benefits, and what the implications of having these perceptions are. It was predicted that people make distinctions for self versus others when considering the potential outcomes of Facebook use. The optimistic bias framework was applied to under stand these self–other discrepant perceptions. 
The findings expand and refine the standard framework of optimistic bias in the realm of social media, and make sev eral distinct contributions to the understanding of subsequent behaviors and mechanisms under these self–other discrepant perceptions. First, the study extends the framework of opti mistic bias13 to an array of potential negative and positive outcomes of Facebook use, ranging from cyberbullying,11 and the effects on self-esteem,2 to enhanced social integra tion and social support. Strong optimistic biases for social

and psychological risks of Facebook use emerged: partici pants perceived that they were less likely to encounter these negative outcomes (e.g., depression, loneliness, and Face book cyberbullying) relative to other users. Although some might argue that it is still premature to claim that Facebook use is a direct predictor of extreme events such as clini cal depression35 and suicidal attempts, a growing line of research indicates that negative events such as Facebook cyberbullying can result in detrimental consequences, in cluding depression and substance use problems.12 Without adequate protections and regulatory oversight, the damage of these critical events can be severe. This is especially the case for those in a vulnerable health condition, in which this op timistic bias for risk events can leave them unprepared without adequate health protective behaviors.36 
Despite robust effect sizes for optimistic biases toward negative psychological and social outcomes (H1)—Cohen’s d = - 0.91 and Cohen’s d = - 1.18 respectively—only opti mistic biases for socially negative outcomes (e.g., Facebook scams) increased support for implementing strict regulations and Facebook policies (H2a). However, this was not the case

outcomes (e.g., depression; H2b). This pattern, in which

The reversed optimistic bias concerning positive outcomes 
w
o

of Facebook use (e.g., sense of closeness with friends and connectedness to their community) is a novel and intriguing effect. Although some argue that logging into Facebook fulfills affiliation38 and psychological needs, participants did not perceive that they were more likely to gain seemingly positive outcomes from Facebook use. Instead, participants continued to believe that these events would be more likely to happen to others. 
This reversal effect manifested among those with negative attitudes toward Facebook and those who had lower Face book involvement. Indeed, these two concepts have been fundamental rationales for optimistic bias in many different situations.18,19 Prior studies on optimistic biases hinted that optimistic bias is influenced by conditional factors,13 such as stereotypes of the events, people’s attitudes toward events, and their personal involvement with these events. The neg ative attitudes toward Facebook could be due to the possibly negative connotations associated with expecting benefits from Facebook use. For instance, people with negative atti tudes toward Facebook might have believed that seeking 
remedies for psychological or social well-being from Face book indicates poor face-to-face interpersonal skills or so cially undesirable attributes. Hence, the emergence of the optimistic bias reversal effect may have reflected participants distancing themselves from expecting benefits from Face book use. This reversal has broader implications for opti mistic bias, and suggest that the processes of optimistic bias involve not only motivational factors (e.g., self-serving views about one’s future events) but also cognitive reasoning (determining if the events are personally beneficial).39 
A recent phenomenon of interest here is the population of users who have stopped using Facebook. Stieger et al.40 found that users with privacy concerns, scoring highly in conscientiousness, and having concerns about Internet ad diction were most likely to deactivate their Facebook ac count completely. One other reason might be that Facebook quitters do not hold the kinds of optimistic biases around negative Facebook use that we observed here. That is, they anticipated negative effects for themselves, and not just others. This is an important avenue of future research that goes beyond personality differences. 
Finally, the results should be understood within the limi tations imposed by the research method. The college student sample in the study limits the generalizability of the results to a larger population. However, this sampling procedure was reasonable for a first study on optimistic bias on Facebook and for the population of interest here: regular Facebook users. Multivariate relationships were also investigated among conceptual variables, which are likely to show con sistent results when conducted with a random sample of the general population.41 Nonetheless, future research should expand the scope of the populations to test the generaliz ability of the results. Intentions for taking protective actions were tested in the study, but future research should also test other types of behaviors that could have been influenced by optimistic biases, such as increased hours on Facebook use, and changes in privacy or security settings. Future research should also examine other driving factors of optimistic biases for Facebook risks and benefits, such as the type and degree of one’s Facebook activities, and the strength of one’s net work ties. This approach, along with assessing optimistic biases for an extended array of potential risks and benefits of Facebook use, will shed light on developing Facebook lit eracy that can enhance awareness and skills to reap benefits while reducing potential risks.
