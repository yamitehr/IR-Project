Abstract  
Economists have predicted that sales on Facebook storefronts may reach $15 billion by  2015; however, sales at the end of 2011 totaled only $1 billion. The current study  explored these sales inefficiencies in the United States Facebook retail market. Using the  diffusion of innovations theory, this phenomenological study investigated the marketing  strategies of United States-based Facebook storefront retailers that were most effective at  converting Facebook social network fans into individuals who actually conduct financial  PREVIEW 
transactions in Facebook storefronts (buyers). Data derived and analyzed from  interviews with 18 expert Facebook marketing professionals suggested several themes for  successful fan-to-buyer conversion such as building brand awareness, engaging fans in  conversation with the retailer, employing electronic and word-of-mouth communication,  using promotions, and increasing fan trust through frequent and consistent  communication. Facebook retailers may benefit from the study results by incorporating  the study findings in their marketing strategy. The implications for positive social change  include retailers using their retail Facebook page as a means to build awareness and  
promote the support of charitable work  
to a potential audience of millions.

Section 1: Foundation of the Study  
Facebook is the world’s largest social networking site (SNS) with over 900  million members, or fans worldwide (Robbin, 2012). Facebook has over 170 million  members in the United States alone, with each averaging 130 friends (Katona, Zubcsek,  & Sarvary, 2011). Since June 2009, Facebook has been transitioning beyond just a social  media site, and into a viable commerce venue (Sands, Harper, & Ferraro, 2011).  Projected retail sales through Facebook storefronts (retailers that run Facebook pages and  PREVIEW
conduct e-commerce transactions through the Facebook pages) may grow to $15 billion  by 2015 (Word of Mouth Marketing Association, 2011). The purpose of this qualitative,  phenomenological study was to investigate marketing strategies delivered by United  States-based Facebook storefront retailers to determine which marketing strategies are  most effective at converting retail Facebook fans to Facebook storefront buyers.  
Facebook commerce is a new phenomenon in which retailers create electronic,  commerce “storefronts” within their Facebook fan page. People can like a retailer’s fan  page and then have access to the Facebook commerce site (Parry, 2011). Facebook  commerce, or F-commerce, is in an experimental stage; however, retailers are trying  different marketing strategies to increase sales through their Facebook storefront and seek  to find ways to convert Facebook fans into buyers (Ning-Shen & Khalifa, 2010).  
One such marketing strategy is building relationships with fans through the  retailer’s Facebook fan page. When Facebook retailers engage fans by posting comments  onto their wall page, they hope to build an interactive conversation, which may help to  
2  
increase consumer loyalty and provide greater brand awareness (Foster, Francescucci, &  West, 2010). Another marketing strategy retailers’ use is to post updates on the retail fan  page by offering exclusive fan-only sales and promotions (Parry, 2011).  
Retailers with a Facebook fan page and storefront realize the influence of  electronic word-of-mouth communication, especially through Facebook (Parent,  Plangger, & Bal, 2011). Retailers can expand awareness to potential new fans by having  their current fans post comments, like page information, or share pictures or videos so  PREVIEW
their friends can see the details (Sands et al., 2011). An electronic word-of-mouth  strategy is important for retailers, as 23% of Americans spend time online, while 70% of  consumers respond to posts or recommendations from a friend on Facebook (Lee & Cho,  2011). In this study, I investigated marketing strategies that were effective at converting  Facebook fans to buyers on the retail Facebook storefront (Sands et al., 2011).  Background of the Problem  
Social networking sites connect people with each other and help them to stay in  contact with friends and family (Mital & Sarkar, 2011). Facebook, one such social  networking site, has been in existence, and available to the public, since 2006 (Ulusu,  2010). With over 900 million members, Facebook is the leading social networking site; it  surpassed Google as the number one viewed website (Katona et al., 2011). Nearly one  third of the United States population has an active Facebook account (Foux, 2010).  
The process of buying and selling products has evolved from traditional physical  storefronts, to catalog shopping, then shopping electronically using online retail  
3  
storefronts, and most recently to the social media venue, Facebook, for transactions  (Jansen, Sobel, & Cook, 2011). The ability to make purchases through a retail side of  Facebook is a recent phenomenon that began in July 2009 (Parry, 2011).  
Electronic commerce, generally, is a popular way for consumers to shop, and  making a retail purchase online is now a familiar process for most people (Carlson &  O’Cass, 2010). Among internet users in the United States, 94% have made an online  purchase, with 57% making a purchase in the past month (Botha, Farshid, & Pitt, 2011).  
PREVIEW
Once a consumer makes an online purchase, 85% will come back and repurchase  (Hannah & Lybecker, 2010). Consumers feel comfortable with making online purchases  and using emerging technologies, such as Facebook, to make these transactions (Cromer,  2010). Social media sites, such as Facebook, are becoming more influential than  traditional media (Botha et al., 2011).  
1-800-Flowers was the first retailer to conduct an online transaction through a  Facebook storefront (Parry, 2011). Since July 2009, commerce through Facebook has  evolved in three different ways. A Facebook retailer may sell (a) through an application,  or app, built for the Facebook page by the retailer or by a third party vendor; (b) through  Facebook’s iframes platform, which is building a website within the framework of  Facebook; or (c) by adding a direct link to an already established commerce site in the  Facebook about section (Parry, 2011). Facebook storefronts are still in the infancy stages  of development for many retailers. Out of the top 500 brick and mortar retailers, only  10% are selling through a Facebook storefront, and 15% have not yet created a Facebook  
4  
fan page (Dernery, 2011). Retailers view the Facebook marketplace as a strategic  opportunity to connect, inexpensively, with new and existing consumers (Lipsman,  Mudd, Rich, & Bruich, 2012).  
It is advantageous for retailers to build a Facebook storefront, as currently  Facebook does not charge for this service, nor do they take a percentage of sales (Park,  Kee, & Valenzuela, 2009). However, this evolution has been slow because retailers do  not know how to get started, they do not have a plan to engage fans as aggressively and  PREVIEW
regularly as needed, and if they have a Facebook page, it is not set up to handle retail  transactions (Terry & Savitz, 2011). Despite Facebook being a free platform through  which to sell products, retailers doubt whether the site can be a profitable venue due to  the lack of a stable Facebook business model (Jiyoung, 2011).  
Retailers that do decide to build a Facebook storefront may need a Facebook  storefront app created by third party vendor businesses (Braue, 2011). These third party  vendors offer retailers the services required to build a Facebook storefront, from which  fans can shop and make purchases. Retailers usually do not have the technical resources  to build their own app, thus seek out the help of a third party vendor. The third party  vendor business, Payvment, also integrates analytic tools so retailers are able to analyze  their fans shopping habits, allowing the retailer to develop better target marketing  strategies (Payvment, 2011).  
Third party vendors who offer the storefront building services will often offer  maintenance and updates to the Facebook storefront so retailers can keep the site new and  
5  
up to date, allowing fans to come back, enjoy the site, and make a purchase (Braue,  2011). Retail Facebook fans no longer have to leave the Facebook framework to a go to  a different retail website to make a purchase. Retail Facebook fans are able to be social  on the Facebook site and conduct commerce transactions in a seamless experience. As a  result, many retailers are beginning to expand their presence onto Facebook (Geron,  2011).  
Retailers who started to market through Facebook had the challenge of gathering  PREVIEW
data to analyze their return on investment (ROI) (Pfeiffer & Zinnbauer, 2010). However,  Facebook has recently upgraded their analytics tool, Insights, to allow companies with  more than 30 fans to access key data including page, content, referral, and demographic  data (Lipsman et al., 2012). Additionally, third party companies who build apps are  beginning to integrate detailed analytics tools into the storefront app creation (Payvment,  2011). The increased availability of analytical tools will help retailers to be more willing  to incorporate a retail Facebook storefront and other social media marketing strategies  into their strategic marketing mix (Lipsman et al., 2012).  
Among the marketing strategies implemented by retailers with a Facebook  storefront are advertising and promotional strategies (Bernal, 2010). Facebook provides  retailers with several methods to advertise and promote the storefront. Included in these  methods are (a) updating a status on the fan page, (b) allowing Facebook fans to like and  follow a retail page, (c) setting up a ticker on the right hand side of all Facebook member  pages that allow fans to see any updates or likes to a page, (d) the ability to share photos  
6  
and videos, and (e) purchasing ads on Facebook that can be targeted to a specific  geography and demographic (Pfeiffer & Zinnbauer, 2010). Several promotional  strategies such as interactive videos, exclusive sales, and coupons on Facebook fan pages  were effective promotional methods to build customer loyalty for online retail websites  (Pfeiffer & Zinnbauer, 2010).  
Facebook may provide value to retailers through further social connectedness  between retailers and fans. Facebook appeals to its members because of the sense of  PREVIEW
connection it offers and the easy ability to share personal details with others (van Manen,  2010). Facebook allows for an interactive, real-time relationship between retailers and  fans by allowing fans to post on the retailer’s Facebook fan page and the retailer or other  fans may respond (Sexton, 2012). Conversations between the retailers and fans on  Facebook pages encourage fans to become a part of a community, resulting in a sense of  belonging for the fans (“Everyone’s getting”, 2011). Each quarter, 60% of retail  consumers turns to the practice of online shopping and the opportunity for retailers to  capture and retain these shoppers are critical for continuing business success (Internet  Retailer, 2011a). Facebook is a powerful social networking site that allows retailers to  connect and strengthen relationships with fans (Sexton, 2012).  
Retailers should not underestimate the value of friends sharing information on  Facebook (Castronovo & Huang, 2012). Electronic, word-of-mouth communication is an  important marketing strategy for retailers with a Facebook storefront as fans influence  their friends to like the retailer’s Facebook fan page (Trusov, Bucklin, & Pauwels, 2009).  
7  
Facebook retailers who use the marketing strategy of connecting with fans through  electronic word-of-mouth are more successful at building fan interest in their Facebook  fan page, as 49% of fans will make purchase decisions after reading a Facebook post  (Sands et al., 2011). Facebook retailers may then track their fans to understand their  communication patterns, with the hope of building a relationship between fans and the  retailers (Katona et al., 2011).  
The benefits of Facebook extend beyond just a social and commerce platform. A  PREVIEW
retailer with a Facebook storefront has tremendous potential to reach thousands, if not  millions of fans with a message and call to action to promote social change, whether on a  national level or in a small community (Crews & Stitt-Gohdes, 2012). Facebook is a  communication tool with far reach. A Facebook page allows retailers to share  information through posts, photographs, and videos. Sharing these activities with the fan  base may inspire fans to become involved with a national cause, or participate in a local  benefit outing. Expanding the virtual Facebook community can result in real community  involvement or an initiative put into action (Henderson & Arora, 2010).  Problem Statement  
As of May 2011, Facebook had more than 150 million fans over the age of 18,  from the United States, with 78% accessing the site at least twice a day (Sheldon, Abad,  & Hinsch, 2011). By 2011, 99% of online retailers had a Facebook presence (Rosen &  Phillips, 2011). Retail sales on Facebook may reach $15 billion in revenue by 2015;  however, in 2011 retail sales through Facebook storefronts lagged behind economists’  
8  
forecasts and reached only near $1 billion in sales (Word of Mouth Marketing  Association, 2011). The general business problem was a lack of retailer understanding  about what marketing strategies would work best through Facebook (Sands et al., 2011).  The specific topic that I explored in this study was the marketing strategies, used by  Facebook retailers that were most effective at converting Facebook fans to Facebook  buyers.  
Purpose Statement  
PREVIEW
The purpose of this qualitative, phenomenological study was to explore the  marketing strategies delivered by United States retailers with a Facebook storefront and  determine which marketing strategies were most effective at converting their Facebook  fans to Facebook buyers. The study sample included 18 adult male and female Facebook  retail marketing professionals who had recent and relevant experience creating and  implementing marketing strategies for retail Facebook storefronts. The marketing  professional participants were residents of the United States and had at least 1 year of  retail Facebook storefront marketing experience. As a part of their professional job  experience, the participants had experience analyzing retail transactions and sales results  influenced through marketing strategies used through Facebook within the past 6 months.  The research results provided a better understanding of the marketing strategies  implemented by marketing professionals. This resulted in Facebook fans converting to  Facebook storefront buyers.  
9  
The results of this study may promote social change in several ways. Small,  medium, and large retailers may better understand which marketing strategies are most  effective to convert fans to buyers, thereby increasing sales (Terry & Savitz, 2011). The  outcomes of the study may have an application for organizations that wish to engage in  philanthropic ventures through Facebook (Dyrud, 2011). A retailer with a Facebook  storefront gains social value and brand awareness through philanthropic causes on  Facebook, while their supported charity experiences increased awareness and funding for  PREVIEW
their cause (Henderson & Arora, 2010).  
Nature of the Study  
I used qualitative research methods for this study. Qualitative research uncovers  relationships and allows for an understanding of complex scenarios (Stavros & Westberg,  2009). The opportunity to conduct retail transactions through Facebook has only been in  existence since 2009 (Dernery, 2011). With over 150 million United States Facebook  fans over the age of 18, Facebook use has become a consistent pattern of social behavior,  but retail Facebook storefront transaction behavior patterns are not yet understood  (Dernery, 2011).  
I selected the qualitative research method over a quantitative or a mixed methods  study. As the researcher, I found that the qualitative research method did not test  objective theories through the examination of relationships among variables as in a  quantitative study (Barnham, 2010). Strength of qualitative methodology, as compared to  quantitative methodology, is in how the research contains specific descriptions of  
10  
personal experiences and the interviewer can ask deep, meaningful questions to gain a  response (Sandelowski, 2000). The participants can provide answers through a  spontaneous flow of information (Keegan, 2009).  
A qualitative method was a better approach, as compared to a quantitative  method, to investigating retail Facebook marketing strategies that are most effective at  converting Facebook fans to Facebook storefront buyers. A quantitative study is best  used when the researcher wants to test a theory or explanation, and the phenomenon of  PREVIEW
shopping through a Facebook storefront is in the introductory stage of the lifecycle, and  little research has been conducted, or theories developed that explain the phenomena  (Turner, 2010). The quantitative method cannot measure important aspects of human  behavior and day-to-day life experiences (Turner, 2010), which I needed to investigate  for this study, in order to understand effective marketing strategies.  
A mixed methods study is a sequential collection of data that incorporate both  quantitative and qualitative data (Turner, 2010). Used when either method is insufficient  on its own, mixed methods research equally integrates quantitative and qualitative  research data (Turner, 2010). In-depth, personal interviews with retail Facebook  marketing experts with experience in managing or analyzing retail Facebook storefronts  provided detailed information regarding effective Facebook marketing strategies;  therefore, a qualitative method was a sufficient research methodology. A mixed methods  approach was not appropriate for research into the thoughts and feelings of individuals  (Turner, 2010).  
11  
A purpose of qualitative, phenomenological research is to understand human  behavior patterns (Groenewald, 2004). A qualitative, phenomenological study focuses on  people who share similar behavior habits (Groenewald, 2004). Furthermore,  phenomenological researchers study what is not necessarily obvious, attempting to  uncover lived truths (van Manen, 2010). In a qualitative, phenomenological study, the  researcher is able to discover topics and themes, determine the relationship between these  topics and themes, and describe the results (Rossiter, 2008).  
PREVIEW
As the researcher, I selected a phenomenological research design because the  focus is not only on individual’s real-life situations and experiences, but also how these  experiences contribute to individual understanding of the environment in which the  individuals live (Trochim, 2006). Other qualitative research methods were not as  relevant as a phenomenological qualitative study. A narrative research design and case  study design focused on only one or just a few participants (Larsson & Sjoblom, 2010).  Both of these methods would involve too few participants; therefore, a false  understanding of the research would have resulted (Turner, 2010). A grounded theory  study is a systematic and sequential analysis of data used to develop a new theory when  existing theories cannot explain the phenomena (Urquhart, Lehman, & Myers, 2010) and  was not applicable to this study because few current theories exist related to Facebook  commerce. The phenomenological research method was the best method for this study  because it allowed me to seek and describe the complete meaning of the marketing  strategy (Moustakas, 1994). Through the research results, I found an understanding of
