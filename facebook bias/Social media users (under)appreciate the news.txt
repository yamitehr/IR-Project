Abstract 
News outlets rely on social media to freely distribute content, offering  a venue for users to comment on news. This exposes individuals to  user comments prior to reading news articles, which can influence  perceptions of news content. A 2 × 2 between-subject experiment  (N = 690) tested the hostile media bias theory via the influence of  comments seen before viewing a news story on perceptions of bias  and credibility. Results show that user comments induce hostile  media perceptions.

Keywords 
online news, hostile media bias, hostile media effect, Facebook, credibility Online news dissemination no longer remains a new or unique venture. News  
outlets are using social media platforms as a place for content distribution and  user engagement (Ellis, 2015; Jensen, 2016). Social media platforms offer a  free place for users to comment on stories (Miller et al., 2016; Rowe, 2015). Facebook  is the most popular outlet for news consumption among U.S. adults (Gramlich, 2019)  because it seems to be a quick and easy way for Facebook users to access large amounts  of news. (note, however, that individual news media have not found Facebook an  ideal—or profitable—way to distribute their content to interested readers, and discern 
ing news consumers do not find Facebook an ideal way to obtain complete, high quality, and only current news.) 
One unique quality of distributing news via Facebook involves Facebook news  consumers being exposed to posted user comments about the story topic before access ing and reading a news article. Therefore, this change presents a new opportunity for  audiences to be influenced by the hostile media effect, a phenomenon that occurs  when strong partisans tend to perceive media content as being demonstrably biased  against their opinion (Perloff, 2015). Although limited knowledge exists about whether  viewing others’ comments may cause news consumers to judge news, literature has  started to take into account the exposure to user comments (e.g., Kümpel & Unkel,  2020; Miller et al., 2016). In fact, recent work has found user comments added to posts  made by news organizations to advertise stories on Facebook can impact subsequent  judgment(s) about news content, even before reading the story (e.g., Gearhart et al.,  2020). Thus, it can be argued that there is now an increased need to learn under what  contexts audiences are influenced by the hostile media effect. 
By looking at Facebook as a source of news dissemination, this study aims to  answer Perloff’s (2015) call that researchers further test and develop the construct  whereby researchers “integrate the hostile media effects, developed as it was in a mass  media era, with contemporary social media” (p. 722). This work tests whether percep 
tions of news bias and aspects of journalistic credibility vary due to exposure to  Facebook user comments seen before accessing a news story. Furthermore, this work  differentiates itself from previous studies by its effort to move beyond investigations  that merely focus on strong partisans and, therefore, tests effects among all individuals  (i.e., not limited to strong partisans) and across multiple story topics. Results provide  further insight about how qualities of social media, which are now being used as news  distribution platforms, may be transforming news consumption in unexpected ways. 
Literature Review 
News Dissemination Via Social Media 
Traditional media outlets, a very high percentage of which have websites (and  many have apps and/or send out email newsletters) have become a prominent platform  for digital news distribution, outreach, and news consumption (“Digital News Fact 
Gearhart et al. 435 
Sheet,” 2021). In addition, as of 2018, at least 68% percent of U.S. adults reportedly  access news on social media platforms and most do so on Facebook (Shearer & Matsa,  2018). Traditional media outlets and social media also converge when legacy media  reporters are accessible on social media, which 74% of Americans like (Jones, 2019). 
Observing Facebook as a source used for news dissemination, this study comple ments previous findings discussed in accordance to hostile media bias in online set tings. Due to the posed differences between new and traditional media, the concept of  interactivity aids in the transformation of “passive receivers of political information  into full-fledged political Facebook posters, empowered sources of persuasive mes sages, and sometimes raging digital partisans” (Perloff, 2015, p. 719). So this study  specifically tests the effects of comments posted by Facebook users toward perception  formation pertaining to online news among audiences in a social media platform. 
Hostile Media Bias 
Originally proposed by Vallone et al. (1985), the hostile media effect, also called  hostile media bias, is the name given to audiences perceiving identical news content to  be biased against their own opinion. Specifically, their work found that audiences who  strongly favored either Israel or Palestine reported an identical television news report  about the conflict in the Middle East to be biased against their own opinion (Vallone  et al., 1985). Based on this early work, studies have concluded this perceptual bias  explains that strong partisans, or those who self-identify their membership in a group  on a particular issue (e.g., pro-life or pro-choice), are individually motivated and more  likely to perceive media presentations as hostile against their own point of view  (Dalton et al., 1998; Gunther, 1992; K. S. Kim & Pasadeos, 2007; Vallone et al., 1985).  Studies have since identified factors that may induce hostile media bias, such as likeli hood to assimilate, accept face-value information, scrutinize oppositional information,  or social identity precursors (e.g., Giner-Sorolla & Chaiken, 1994; Lord et al., 1979;  Perloff, 1989). 
Overall, empirical tests of hostile media effect have traditionally been conducted  with print news or broadcast television news (Hansen & Kim, 2011) and cable televi sion news, which includes partisan commentary (Coe et al., 2008). Investigations tend  to produce consistent findings among strong partisans who perceive bias in news con tent, even when the content is presented as balanced stories (K. S. Kim & Pasadeos,  2007). Outcomes of hostile media bias influence perceptions, such increasing polar ization of attitudes (Lord et al., 1979) and enhancing distrust in news media (Perloff,  2015). 
Hostile media bias and online comments 
More recently, investigations have focused on online news and demonstrated mixed  outcomes (M. Kim, 2015). For instance, Houston et al. (2011) experimentally tested  whether comments on news websites influence audience perceptions of bias. They  found comments can impact perceptions of news media bias and concluded that “user  comments accompanying online content can influence perceptions of that content” on  websites (Houston et al., 2011, p. 88). Similarly, Lee (2012) manipulated the content  of online user comments that appearing with an online news story about banning cor 
poral punishment in South Korean grade schools. Results showed individuals exposed 
436 Newspaper Research Journal 42(4) 
to a story featuring comments expressing likeminded viewpoints had lower percep tions of news media bias than those exposed to opposing comments (Lee, 2012). However, later work by Chung et al. (2015) contradicted these findings. Although  they found overarching support for hostile media bias as participants evaluated neutral  stories to be biased against their own opinion, when assessing the influence of user  comments it was concluded that the comments did not impact perceptions of media  bias (Chung et al., 2015). While this appears to cast some doubt on research finding  that partisan comments may influence hostile media perception, comments presented  to respondents contained an equal number of comments on either side of the issue at  hand, essentially providing a neutral climate of opinion. Regardless, Chung et al.  (2015) suggest that user comments posted on news articles have the ability to serve as  a type of cue to the audience. Yun et al. (2018) further investigated the impact of user  comments on audience member perceptions. Through manipulation, participants were  shown user comments under a news story that either reflected or opposed their opin ions in blog posts. While the comments did not appear to influence perceptions of bias,  the authors note their manipulation may not have been effective, and the issue (i.e.,  economic policy) may not have resonated with the South Korean college student sam ple (Yun et al., 2018). 
While findings concerning the influence of user comments on hostile media per ceptions have been mixed, limited work has tested this phenomenon in social media  environments. Although not directly testing hostile media bias, related research tends  to support the conclusion that user comments seen on social media outlets are capable  of influencing how audiences receive online content. For instance, research has shown  YouTube comments on videos featuring public service announcements about mari juana influence video evaluations (Walther et al., 2010). In a recent exploration of  hostile media bias, Gearhart et al. (2020) tested whether user comments seen on  Facebook posts used by news outlets to advertise stories influence audience percep tions. Results showed encountering comments before reading a news story impact  audience perceptions. Specifically, Facebook users exposed to comments that dis agreed with their own opinion on the topic, which were seen before accessing a news  story, reported feeling that the story content, the writer, and the news outlet responsible  for publication were biased against their own opinion when compared to those exposed  to likeminded comments that aligned with the users own personal beliefs on the issue  (Gearhart et al., 2020). Similarly, those exposed to Facebook comments disagreeing  with their own point of view reported lower perceptions of journalistic practices  reflecting professional and civic credibility compared to those who saw likeminded  comments before accessing the story (Gearhart et al., 2020). These findings demon strate that comments accompanying news content shared via social media may be  capable of impacting audience perceptions, especially that of bias in relations to one’s  own beliefs and personal ideology. The need remains to both replicate these findings  across issue contexts and explore how comments posted by other social media users  may impact audience perceptions of journalistic practices. 
News comments and perceptions of journalism 
Most U.S. adults gain at least a portion of their news through social media, which  has surpassed newspapers as a dominant platform of news (Shearer & Gottfried, 2017;  Shearer, 2018). As news organizations increasingly distribute content on social media, 
Gearhart et al. 437 
there is reason to suspect that comments posted by other users can impact the reception  of journalistic content. For instance, Kümpel and Unkel (2020) recently demonstrated  that user comments on Twitter induced negativity bias when comments were presented  after a news story. The authors note that comment presentation order and the degree to  which comments were deemed positive or negative (i.e., valence) influenced how  individuals perceive journalistic quality. Kümpel and Unkel (2020) highlight the need  to further explore the influence of comments in congruent/incongruent contexts and  further probe the effect of this online feature on news audiences. 
The strong influence of social media comments on news audiences’ perceptions has  also been demonstrated in studies beyond testing of the hostile media bias hypothesis.  For example, Pjesivac et al. (2018) observed that the expertise of sources in news  stories may influence subsequent perceptions of credibility within news articles shared  via social platforms. Similarly, Waddell (2018) found negative Twitter comments  posted on news tend to decrease audience perceptions of credibility and incivility in  comments shape perceptions of audience evaluations of news. In fact, Waddell (2018)  further claimed that audience incivility that appears in posted comments is capable of  shaping audience evaluations and basic functions of news media. Furthermore, incivil ity in comments has also been found to shape audience evaluations of news (Pjesivac  et al., 2018). One-sided social media comments posted on online news about health  issues may influence a reader’s perception of the topic regardless of existent knowl 
edge (Witteman et al., 2016). Likewise, negative comments on news distributed on  Facebook have also been found to induce negative attitudes, unlike positive comments  posted by other users (Winter et al., 2015). These findings provide related evidence  that the Facebook platform presents an ideal outlet to apply hostile media bias to  examine the influence of user comments on news audience perceptions of journalism.  Facebook is the primary platform for news among U.S. adults (Shearer & Grieco,  2019; Shearer & Mitchell, 2021) and news organizations are reliant on Facebook  (which has repeatedly changed news-related policies) for audience interaction and  news dissemination (however disappointing those have sometimes been to the news  organizations). Therefore, it is necessary to examine whether features of this distribu tion approach may have adverse implications for news audiences. 
Issue Topics 
To better understand the theoretical scope of concepts, such as hostile media bias  (Shoemaker et al., 2004), it is necessary to test multiple issue contexts. Evidence sup ports the potential to identify hostile media effects in online settings, but a need  remains to examine the effects across varying issues topics because they are likely to  generate varying feedback and commentary from users (which cultivate the climate of  opinion experienced by observers). Therefore, this study examines multiple partisan  issues to further understand the influence of comments on audience perceptions,  including climate change and abortion. 
Climate change 
The climate change issue can modestly be defined as an alteration in the typical  weather experienced in a particular area and an overall change in climate across Earth  (NASA, 2011). Around the world, climate change is viewed as a major threat (Poushter 
438 Newspaper Research Journal 42(4) 
& Manevich, 2017). Yet, in the United States, climate change is a highly debated topic  that is divided by polarized views that concern the basic existence/causes of the issue.  In particular, opinion divisions can be broadly categorized in three groups including:  (a) those who believe climate change is occurring as a result of man-made activity; (b)  those who believe climate change is occurring due to natural causes; and (c) those who  reject the idea of climate change (Funk & Kennedy, 2016). Uniquely, political division  is a powerful force behind opinions about this topic. In fact, partisanship has been  found to transcend across every aspect of the climate debate, including trust in climate  scientists, and is a stronger factor than scientific knowledge (Funk, 2017). 
Abortion 
Among the U.S. population, abortion remains a deeply contested issue that divides  citizens. Although the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade (1973) ruling extended the  right to privacy privileges between a woman and her physician, the topic has dis sected the American public on the legality of abortion along partisan lines (Pew  Research Center, 2017). Although an individual’s position on the topic is often com plicated by debates surrounding the situational nature of choosing abortion (e.g.,  health risk to mother/child; whether pregnancy resulted from rape or incest), two  groups represent general positions. One one hand, pro-choice advocates hold that  women deserve a right to privacy between themselves and their doctors, and further,  that women deserve the right to choose whether to pursue an abortion. Supporters of  this position tend to be liberal constituents and are more accepting of legalized access  to abortion. On the other hand, pro-life advocates are opposed to the legalization of  abortion based on the belief that a “right to life” should be extended upon conception.  Supporters of this position tend to be conservative constituents who are less accept ing of legalized access to abortion. These two groups (who each vary from moderate  to extreme because the majority of Americans do not have extreme positions on abor tion) are of keen interest in this study, as abortion is an often debated topic on social  media sites like Facebook. 
Research Questions and Hypotheses 
Based on the literature highlighted above, there is reason to believe that Facebook  user comments seen prior to reading news articles may alter perceptions of bias within  the news and perceptions of a journalist’s credibility. Thus, the following research  questions and hypotheses guide this work: 
RQ1: 
Does the topic of a news story (i.e., either abortion or climate change) alter audi ence perceptions of news bias? 
H1: 
Exposure to one-sided comments (i.e., either likeminded or dissimilar) will alter  audience perceptions of news bias.
Gearhart et al. 439 
RQ2: 
Do audience perceptions of bias within the news interact as a function of story topic  and exposure to likeminded or dissimilar comments? 
RQ3: 
Does the topic of a news story alter audience perceptions of a journalist’s profes sional credibility? 
H2: 
Exposure to user comments will differently alter perceptions of a journalist’s pro fessional credibility. 
RQ4: 
Do audience perceptions of credibility interact as a function of story topic and  exposure to comments? 
Method 
Participants and Procedures 
Using a 2 × 2 between-subject experimental design, this study recruited partici pants through the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. MTurk is an online  crowdsourcing platform that hosts a pool of potential research participants who receive  monetary compensation for participation (Casler et al., 2013). Participants were  required to be based in the United States and be Facebook users. Once qualified,  respondents (N = 690) were randomly assigned to a topic (i.e., either abortion or cli mate change) and asked to voluntarily complete self-reports used to identify their  stance on the issue. To vary the news story topic, an experimental manipulation was  embedded to alternate the issue and Facebook comments encountered. Once randomly  assigned to a topic (i.e., either abortion or climate change), participants were asked to  indicate their own opinion the specific issue. For example, on the topic of abortion,  respondents were told to think about their assigned topic and then asked the following:  “There are many opinions about abortion. If you had to place your opinion in one of  two options below: How would you classify your opinion on abortion?” Response  options included: (a) pro-choice—meaning you support the right to a legal abortion or  (b) pro-life—meaning you oppose abortion (antiabortion). 
Participants were subsequently assigned to a condition featuring Facebook either  comments that aligned with their viewpoint or opposed their viewpoint, indicated  through manipulated posts by other users. Hostile media bias has been identified in  coverage even when news stories were reported fairly (Vallone et al., 1985). Therefore,  this research used a neutral story that appeared across conditions to determine whether  the influence of likeminded Facebook comments can reduce perceptions of bias while  dissimilar comments induce such perceptions.

Stimulus 
Facebook posts previewing a news stories featuring select user comments below  and neutral news articles were constructed to serve as stimuli. The Facebook posts  previewing news stories included five fictional comments that appeared to be posted  by other users and displayed one-sided comments. The news stories were advertised  through a Facebook post featuring a headline posing a rhetorical question (e.g., do  restrictive laws reduce abortions in America?) and a neutral tagline (e.g., The Supreme  Court is expected to deliberate on abortion rights) with an image (e.g., U.S. Supreme  Court building). The Facebook posts advertising the stories featured standardized fea tures, including the same number of fictional shares and use of emojis, across condi 
tions. Furthermore, all news stories were depicted as sourced by The Economist, which  has been rated as the most neutral source of news by American audiences across par tisan lines (Mitchell, 2014). These were shown to participants before exposure to a  neutral news story surrounding the treatment issue (i.e., either climate change or abor tion). Both news stories were created by a university journalism instructor with profes sional experience. The author of the stories strived to provide content presenting both  sides of each issue to produce neutral content while maintaining ecological validity.  Next, a group of doctoral students studying media and communication were asked to  evaluate each news article and assess perceived neutrality. This process led to minor  revisions in the stories to create the final versions shown to participants. After expo sure to the news article, respondent perceptions were assessed, and demographic infor mation was collected. 
Measures 
News bias 
Originally developed as part of a scale created to measure media credibility, this  measure assessed audience perceptions of bias within the news (Gaziano & McGrath,  1986). As an aspect of news credibility, measurement of news bias consisted of four  assessments on a 7-point semantic differential scale. After viewing the news article,  participants rated various aspects of the story, including: (a) bias/unbiased, (b) invades  people’s privacy/does not invade people’s privacy, (c) does watch after the readers  interests/does not watch after the readers interests, and (d) tells the whole story/does  not tell the whole story. Items (a) and (b) were reverse coded so that lower scores  reflected lower audience perceptions of news bias before merging into an additive  index (α = .78; M = 3.79, SD = 1.26). 
Professional credibility 
This evaluation measured perceptions of professional credibility using items from  an existing media credibility scale (Gaziano & McGrath, 1986). Similar to the news  bias measurement scale, this factor was assessed with a 7-point semantic differential  scale that contained eight items including: (a) can/cannot be trusted, (b) does/does not  separate fact from opinion, (c) has well-trained/poorly trained reporters, (d) is factual/ is opinionated, (e) is concerned about the public interest/is concerned about making  profits, (f) is accurate/is inaccurate, (g) is concerned about the community’s well-being/ 
is not concerned about the community’s well-being, and (h) is fair/is unfair. These items 
Gearhart et al. 441 
were each reverse coded so that lower scores reflected a lower perception of credibility  before being merged into an additive index (α = .92; M = 4.75, SD = 1.22). 
Demographics 
Multiple questions gathered demographic information from each participant. The  average participant was 37.22 years old (SD = 11.01). For educational status, the  majority reported having a 4-year degree (M = 4.27, SD = 1.35). The household  income averaged in the range from $50,000 to under $60,000 (1 = less than $24,999 
to 8 = $110,000+; M = 5.05, SD = 2.86). By ideology, most respondents were found  to be moderately liberal (1 = very conservative to 5 = very liberal; M = 3.26, SD = 1.10). Concerning race/ethnicity, the majority were white/Caucasian (77.2%) followed  by Asian (8.9%), black/African American (7.3%), and others (6.6%). 
Findings 
Again, RQ1 asked if story topics differently influence audience perceptions of  news bias. Using a fully factorial analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) controlling for  political ideology, analysis demonstrated a significant effect of the news story topic on  perceptions of news bias F(1, 686) = 7.32, p = .007; ηp2 = . . 01 Review of mean  scores suggests that news articles discussing the topic of abortion result in lower per 
ception of news bias (M = 3.66, SD = 1.06) than news articles about the topic of cli mate change (M = 3.91, SD = 1.42). 
Again, H1 predicted that exposure to one-sided comments would alter audience  perceptions of bias. After controlling for political ideology, data analysis showed a  significant effect of viewing one-sided comments featured on Facebook posts adver tising news stories on perceptions of news bias F(1, 686) = 110.28, p < .001; ηp2 = . . 14 Review of mean scores suggests that when audiences view likeminded comments,  they perceive less news bias in a story (M = 3.32, SD = 1.08) compared to perceptions  of news bias in stories featuring dissimilar comments (M = 4.25, SD = 1.25). As such,  H1 was supported. 
Again, RQ2 questioned if story topic (i.e., either abortion or climate change) and  exposure to comments (i.e., either agreeable or disagreeable) differently influence per ceptions of news bias. Among Facebook news audiences, a fully factorial ANCOVA  controlling for political ideology revealed a significant interaction between the story  topic and exposure to one-sided comments on perceptions of news bias, F(1, 684) = 91.01, p < .001; ηp2 = . . 12 Review of the associated means indicate that audiences  perceive less bias in stories when exposed to likeminded comments when the topic of  the story was on climate change (M = 3.07, SD = 1.08) than when participants viewed  comments expressing dissimilar opinions on about climate change (M = 4.81, SD = 1.18). Similarly, when the topic of the story was on abortion, audiences perceived less  bias in stories featuring likeminded comments (M = 3.58, SD = 1.01) than after view ing comments expressing oppositional opinions (M = 3.74, SD = 1.10; see Figure 1). 
Again, RQ3 asked if the story topic influences perceptions of a professional credi bility of the media among audiences. Using a fully factorial ANCOVA controlling for  political ideology, a review of the data demonstrated a significant main effect of news  article topic on perceptions of professionalism F(1, 682) = 12.16, p = .001; ηp2 = . . 02 Review of the associated mean scores indicates that audiences who saw the news story 
442 Newspaper Research Journal 42(4) 
reporting on climate change had greater perceptions of professional credibility (M = 4.92, SD = 1.32) than did audiences who viewed the news story on the topic of abor tion (M = 4.60, SD = 1.11). 
Again, H2 predicted that exposure to one-sided comments among audiences will  influence perceptions of professional credibility. After controlling for political ideol ogy, data analysis demonstrated a main effect of viewing one-sided Facebook com ments on posts advertising the story on perceptions of professional credibility among  audiences F(1, 682) = 20.51, p < .001; ηp2 = . . 03 Review of mean scores demon strates that exposure to likeminded comments led participants to perceive greater pro fessional credibility in a story (M = 4.96, SD = 1.17) compared to those exposed to  dissimilar comments (M = 4.55, SD = 1.25). Thus, H2 was supported. 
Again, RQ4 asked if story topic (i.e., either abortion or climate change) and expo sure to comments (i.e., either agreeable or disagreeable) differently influenced percep tions of news professionalism among audiences. Among Facebook news consumers,  the analysis failed to reveal any significant interaction between news article topic and  exposure to one-sided comments on perceptions of professional credibility, F(1, 680) = 1.08, p = ns; ηp2 = .002 (see Figure 2). 
Discussion 
This study intended to test for the hostile media effect in a new media environment,  especially exploring assumptions using a population that was not only limited to  
Figure 1 
Perceived news bias as a function of topic and agreement with posted comments  
Gearhart et al. 443 
strong partisans in an effort to broaden the theoretical scope, specifically as it applies  to social media. As such, this work tests the influence of story topics and comments  posted by Facebook users on perceptions of bias and professional credibility of a news  story within an audience. Overall, results of this work demonstrate not only that con 
troversial story topics may differently resonate with audiences, but exposure to  Facebook comments may be capable of transforming how news is consumed by online  audiences. That is, results seen here demonstrate the effects as a subsequent compo nent of hostility toward news media content and/or reports may in-fact be induced by  Facebook user comments posted on the story, as opposed to psychological attributes of  audience members (e.g., partisanship and issue involvement). These findings support  the claim that different aspects of online news dissemination do not operate in isola tion (Houston et al., 2011). Rather, each component has the ability to exert influence  on news audiences, even after controlling for political ideology. In this case, results  show that story topics and user comments that appear below a Facebook post high lighting news reports may change how news content distributed on that platform is  ultimately perceived. 
Results concerning story topic display unique differences as perceived news bias  was higher for stories reporting on climate change compared to abortion. Differences  in perceptions of bias depending on story topic support previous findings investigating  hostile media bias in online news commenting situations (Chung et al., 2015). Although  the contentious nature of abortion in the United States is enduring, the lower percep 
tions of bias in reporting may be due to the issue itself. Public opinion on abortion has

experienced little fluctuation over the last two decades and remains divided along  partisan lines (“Public Opinion Views on Abortion,” 2017). However, data show 39%  of U.S. adults remain neutral in their stance relating to their identification with abor tion as a political issue (i.e., pro-choice or pro-life). This form of political neutrality  may be due to nuances that factor into personal beliefs (Kliff, 2015); again, the major ity of Americans do not hold extreme positions on abortion. Therefore, the neutral  nature of the story may have contributed to lower perceptions of bias. The heightened  sense of bias noted in the climate change story seems to be indicative of the polarized  nature of the issue. While past research shows that climate change is viewed through  an ideological lens (McCright & Dunlap, 2011), confidence and trust in scientific  authority varies widely on the issue is similarly divided, making it unlikely that citi zens hold nuanced views (Funk & Kennedy, 2016). Taken together, findings about the  role of story topic provide important implications for media professionals who seek to  report on issues experiencing partisan division. Journalists and/or issue advocates will  benefit by knowing that their audience may inherently bring a higher perception of  bias to the table, which should be considered when attempting to inform or influence  attitudes and behaviors. 
Results reveal that posted Facebook comments play a significant role in how audi ences evaluate news content seen on social media. Examination of audience percep tions of existent bias in news stories offered surprising revelations based on exposure  to posts made by other users. Specifically, results indicate a variability as it relates to  audience perceptions of bias as a function of congruency with comments posted by  other unknown Facebook users. This means that individuals who saw likeminded  comments underneath the posted news story itself perceived the news story as less  biased. Therefore, these results align with existent research showcasing how online  comments might induce a priming effect on other users by potentially highlighting a  certain perspective and directing future thought processes (Lee & Tandoc, 2017). 
Taken together, results concerning perceived bias supports the hostile media bias  construct (Vallone et al., 1985) and further applies the hypothesis to social media. This  aligns with research identifying that perceptions of bias vary as a function of personal  congruence with news content (Feldman, 2011). But Feldman (2011) found individu 
als perceived less prejudice among news content that expressed ideologically similar  viewpoints. This study takes this a step further by controlling the content of the news  story and by altering conjoined Facebook comments viewed before reading neutral  news reports. Identifying that comments under the news story impact perceptions of  bias in news articles, regardless of contextual manner as it pertains to the content in the  news story itself, demonstrates how qualities of social media may directly transform  news consumption. However, considering the small to medium effect size observed  within this study, social media commenting may be more prevalent than previously  assumed considering participants’ exposure to comments does indeed bear effects  toward perception formation about online news material that is presented in a social  media context. 
Audience members were also found to view the story as more biased across issues  if the posted comments conflicted with their held opinions. Thus, comments can have  adverse impacts on perceptions of news bias regardless of issue. News organizations  must keep this in mind when deciding whether to allow comments. Encouraging two 
way communication is deemed important by news outlets to enhance audience 
Gearhart et al. 445 
engagement (Ju et al., 2014). Yet, results seen here indicate that this avenue may create  an adverse perception of the news story, regardless of the news content. Therefore, it  may be pertinent to create a different environment for commenting separate from the  news story link itself, as to avoid inducing unwanted perceptions of bias before news  exposure. For instance, The Verge, an online provider of technology news, have begun  experimenting with alternative online forums and saw an initial increase in traffic on  forums after news comments were disabled (Ellis, 2015). 
Higher professional credibility was also perceived when Facebook comments  aligned with an audience member’s own opinions. Based on this finding, news media  organizations should seek ways to establish communication among readers beyond  comments. As these findings suggest, perceptive effects that point to assumptions of  biased news reports alongside a sense of compromised journalistic professionalism  can be generated by comments regardless of story content. Based on this, the story  slant cannot be relied upon to offset held perceptions. These perceptions are formed  before reading the news story because the comments are available to be seen before  clicking on the link. 
This study is limited by the study design. Although the experimental approach pro vides analysis of multiple independent variables, this approach would be improved  with the inclusion of a control condition. Furthermore, the stimulus news content was  depicted as taken from The Economist. Although that outlet is seen as a neutral source  and is rated high for its factual reporting (Van Zandt, 2021), that outlet has been found  to appeal to a niche market and lack familiarity with audiences (Mitchell et al., 2014).  While future research can overcome these issues, results seen here still offer both  practical and theoretical implications. News practitioners should use these findings  and set policy for how they facilitate audience feedback to combat adverse impacts on  perceptions of news bias and professionalism. The continual need to oversee and mod 
erate websites comments was a reason news organizations have turned to social media  (Ellis, 2015). However, organizations should maintain skepticism of encouraging  social media commentary. In terms of theoretical contributions, hostile media bias as  an at-large construct has been researched in the social media realm. As such, there  remain extended possibilities for integration of additional theoretical approaches, such  as selective exposure and priming. Future tests of the hostile media bias hypothesis  across issues and digital platforms should also aim to further delineate core aspects of  the theoretical approach.
