Abstract 
The main aim of this study was to examine the norms of expressing emotions on social  media. Specifically, the perceived appropriateness (i.e. injunctive norms) of expressing  six discrete emotions (i.e. sadness, anger, disappointment, worry, joy, and pride) was  investigated across four different social media platforms. Drawing on data collected  in March 2016 among 1201 young Dutch users (15–25years), we found that positive  expressions were generally perceived as more appropriate than negative expressions  across all platforms. In line with the objective of the study, some platform differences  were found. The expression of negative emotions was rated as most appropriate for  WhatsApp, followed by Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. For positive emotion  expression, perceived appropriateness was highest for WhatsApp, followed by Instagram,  Facebook, and Twitter. Additionally, some gender differences were found, while age  showed little variations. Overall, the results contribute to a more informed understanding  of emotion expression online.

Social media allow individuals to easily share their thoughts and feelings with others. At  the same time, users need to carefully weigh the appropriateness of doing so within the  variety of social contexts that different platforms present. So far, research has pointed

toward an online “positivity bias,” referring to the majority of posted content being posi tively rather than negatively valenced (Reinecke and Trepte, 2014). This has been argued  to be a result of prevailing positivity norms. To date, however, the perceived appropriate ness (i.e. injunctive norms) of expressing emotions on social media has received little  scholarly attention. Understanding which perceived norms of emotion expression prevail  may provide insights not only into social media’s positivity bias but also into the extent  
to which online expressions of negative emotions are considered inappropriate. This study aims to examine the prevailing injunctive norms of emotion expression on  four popular social media platforms (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and WhatsApp).  Injunctive norms refer to the extent to which people perceive certain behaviors to be  appropriate or inappropriate (e.g. Cialdini and Trost, 1998). To gain a nuanced under standing of normative patterns of emotion expression, this study focuses on the expres sion of discrete positive and negative emotions and aims to compare their perceived  appropriateness on different social media platforms. The focus on discrete emotions,  rather than taking a dimensional perspective, offers greater precision in determining how  different self-expressions vary in their perceived appropriateness. In addition, while  much research focuses on single platforms, each social media platform presents a vastly  different social context due to its unique features (e.g. Marwick and boyd, 2011; Wilson  et al., 2012). Understanding differences across platforms thus allows for a clearer view  on the current prevailing norms. 
To further determine patterns of perceived norms in expressing emotions, differences  in age and gender are also considered. Research has thus far generated mixed results in  establishing differences for these demographic variables in expressive behaviors online  (e.g. Taddicken, 2014). However, given the focus on the expression of emotions, men  and women may come to display different perceptions of appropriateness when, for  instance, seen from a socialization perspective (Thelwall et al., 2010). In addition, self 
disclosure marks an important role in adolescent development for which social media  function as one of its primary tools (e.g. Valkenburg and Peter, 2011). To understand  differences in perceived norms from a developmental perspective, both late adolescents  (15–18 years) and emerging adults (19–25years) were selected for this study. 
In sum, the overall goal of this work is to illuminate normative patterns of expressing  emotions on social media by means of a survey. In doing so, we maintain three specific  objectives. First, by investigating the perceived appropriateness of disclosing positive  and negative emotions, this study provides a detailed picture of a potential positivity  bias of online emotion expression. Second, this study aims to elucidate how perceived  injunctive norms of specific emotion expressions differ across different social media  settings. Third, we explore how these perceived injunctive norms vary according to age  and gender. 
Norms, emotion expression, and social media 
Social norms, routinely conceptualized as injunctive and descriptive norms, are regarded  as the explicit and implicit rules that inform individuals on what is deemed acceptable  behavior in a given social context (Cialdini and Trost, 1998). In contrast to descriptive  norms, which in the context of self-expression refer to the observation of what people 
Waterloo et al. 1815 
typically express, injunctive norms refer to the perception of what most people deem  appropriate or inappropriate expressions in certain situations. Moreover, injunctive  norms “motivate behavior by promising social rewards or punishments” (Cialdini and  Trost, 1998: 157). The perceived risks of social punishment that are associated with  injunctive norms are in particular relevant to expressions of emotion. According to the  Disclosure Decision Model, the perceived social risks likely influence the depth of dis 
closures in terms of the sharing of emotionally intense or negative personal information  (Omarzu, 2000). These risks include social rejection, disapproval, or betrayal by others  (Greene et al., 2006), as well as a negative public-image (Leary and Kowalski, 1990).  Studying injunctive norms is thus particularly important for understanding behaviors of  self-expression. 
Many social media platforms encourage emotional self-expression, inviting users to  regularly update on their thoughts, feelings, and experiences to their larger network (e.g.  Derks et al., 2008). Qualitative insights have so far revealed that “overly emotional”  expressions on Facebook are considered norms violations (Lambert, 2015; McLaughlin  and Vitak, 2012). Research has further provided very little empirical insight into which  perceived norms of self-expression prevail on social media. However, empirical studies  have consistently found that individuals post both positive and negative emotional  expressions online, albeit with a bias toward the positive (e.g. Lin et al., 2014). This  “positivity bias” may be due to prevailing positivity norms that social media encourage  (Reinecke and Trepte, 2014). Similarly, research has shown that the expression of posi tive emotions is perceived as considerably more appropriate than negative emotion  expression for offline disclosures (Caltabiano and Smithson, 1983). The reason for this  is that disclosures of negative emotion are seemingly more intimate and therefore per 
ceived as maladjusted behavior when directed at strangers or acquaintances (Chaikin and  Derlega, 1974; Howell and Conway, 1990). 
Several theories have attempted to explain online expressions based on the availabil ity of communicative cues. Users are argued to rely more on verbal communication  strategies (e.g. content and linguistics) to compensate for the lack of nonverbal cues  online (Walther, 1992). In light of this, users might likely express negative emotions  online to establish intimate social connections, as research on co-rumination indicates  that sharing negative experiences could strengthen relational bonds (e.g. Rose, 2002). At  the same time, the hyperpersonal perspective (Walther, 1996, 2007) suggests that due to  the control that online settings provide over one’s self-presentation, individuals more  typically present themselves in a social desirable way (i.e. positively). Conversely, the  reduced nonverbal cues and controllability that online settings afford also facilitate dis 
inhibition, depending on the impression one wants to achieve (Walther, 1996). This dis inhibition can lead to more frequent expression of positive emotions, as well as negative  emotions. The social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE), however, adds  that social context becomes more important in such reduced-cue settings, where users  more strongly rely on prevailing social norms in expressing themselves compared to  face-to-face (Postmes et al., 2000). 
While the expression of negative emotions might not be absent on social media plat forms, the available research still points toward a greater perceived appropriateness of  expressing positive emotions relative to negative emotions. This study examines discrete 
1816 new media & society 20(5) 
emotions rather than taking a valence-based approach (positive vs negative emotions), as  scholars have pointed out that different emotions are associated with different patterns of  appraisal and action tendencies (e.g. Myrick, 2015). Hence, focusing on discrete emo tions is more informative and avoids oversimplifying the patterns of injunctive norms  across social media platforms. The first hypothesis reads as follows: 
H1. The expression of positive emotions (i.e. joy and pride) is considered more appro priate compared to the expression of negative emotions (i.e. sadness, anger, disap pointment, worry) on social media platforms. 
Normative differences across social media platforms 
While seemingly similar, each online social media platform represents a unique social  context in terms of its audience (e.g. Marwick and boyd, 2011). Theoretically, a change  of social context should lead to a difference in prevailing norms as other social identities  become salient (Postmes et al., 2000). However, social media are becoming increasingly  complex in their multi-functionality and evolve at rapid pace, and no theoretical approach  has yet been put forward in comparing specific platforms. However, to tease out platform  differences and the variety of social behaviors that may be found across them, it is useful  to look at the specific features that characterize a platform’s social context. 
For social media, three features can be used to characterize a platform’s social con text, which include behavioral privacy settings, its following-mechanism, and modality.  Behavioral privacy is defined as the extent to which a behavior is performed in a public  or private context (Lapinski and Rimal, 2005). While most social media platforms allow  users to adjust their privacy settings, the default settings often function as the standard  (Debatin et al., 2009). Related to this is the following mechanism that a platform affords:  reciprocal or nonreciprocal. Reciprocal following occurs when two users need to both  accept each other in their network, while nonreciprocal following allows a user to follow  another without that user having to follow in return (Davenport et al., 2014; Lup et al.,  2015). Both these features help in informing the user about the perceived audience of a  particular platform. Finally, the main modalities of content that a platform offers—text,  visuals, or audiovisuals—characterize the type of content that is typically shared. The  combination of these three features helps discern how normative patterns of emotion  expression potentially differ among Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and WhatsApp. 
In terms of behavioral privacy settings, the magnitude of normative influences varies  according to the extent to which behavioral privacy is perceived (Lapinski and Rimal,  2005). In private settings, the social risks related to a given behavior (e.g. emotion  expression) are generally smaller because few people can impart judgment. In contrast,  public settings heighten the perceived social risks because one’s behavior is available for  public scrutiny. Indeed, a study by Bazarova (2012) found that public intimate disclo 
sures were considered less acceptable compared to private intimate disclosures. In this study, WhatsApp provides the highest level of behavioral privacy. Considered  one of the most popular mobile-based instant messenger applications, WhatsApp is gen erally used to communicate directly with one or a few friends and thus represents a 
Waterloo et al. 1817 
private channel of communication (e.g. Karapanos et al., 2016). In contrast, Twitter is a  microblogging site where users can follow others without the need for approval or recip rocation (i.e. nonreciprocal following). Although users can adjust the privacy settings,  the majority maintains the public default, which means that anyone online is able to view  one’s content (Marwick and boyd, 2011). In this respect, the mobile-based social net work site Instagram is largely similar (Lup et al., 2015). On the social network site  Facebook, users typically post content visibly to an articulated list of friends (boyd,  2011), which generates a more bounded semi-public space compared to Twitter and  Instagram. 
The following-mechanism of a platform provides information about the diversity of  tie strengths in one’s network. Consistent with the social penetration hypothesis, disclo sures become more intimate and varied as the relationship between individuals evolves  (Altman and Taylor, 1973), resulting in changing perceptions of appropriateness. Here,  strong ties include close friends, regular friends, and family, while weak ties include  acquaintances and casual contacts (Haythornthwaite, 2005). People are more likely to  disclose personal information to strong ties rather than weak ties because a level of trust  has been able to develop (e.g. Caltabiano and Smithson, 1983). Relatedly, the expression  of negative emotions (i.e. more intimate information) is perceived as less acceptable in  interactions with acquaintances and strangers (Chaikin and Derlega, 1974). 
As to the platforms investigated in this study, WhatsApp is used to primarily interact  with close ties compared to more public platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and  Instagram, which revolve more around communication with weak ties (e.g. Karapanos  et al., 2016). Generally, research confirms that strong ties are more likely to use private  channels to interact than do weak ties (Haythornthwaite, 2005). Facebook is based on  reciprocal following, which makes the proportion of both strong and weak ties in one’s  audience more balanced (e.g. McLaughlin and Vitak, 2012). In contrast, Twitter and  Instagram rely on nonreciprocal following, which is often associated with a larger pro portion of weak ties and the inclusion of strangers in one’s network (Lin et al., 2014; Lup  et al., 2015). 
Finally, the modalities of content that a platform encourages inform what types of con tent users generally share. Current social media platforms allow for multiple modalities of  content, which is especially true for both Facebook and WhatsApp through which text,  visual, and audiovisual content can be shared. However, for both Twitter and Instagram,  the modality of content represents a defining feature. Twitter currently revolves around  publishing short 140-character text messages. This feature has led Twitter to evolve  toward a popular tool for short and immediate commentary on real-time happenings,  including both personal and news events (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2011). Research has  shown that on Twitter, in part due to these characteristics, content is mainly negatively  valenced even when it concerns positive events (Naveed et al., 2011; Thelwall et al.,  2011). Instagram, in contrast, is a platform focused on the sharing of pictures enhanced by  filters. This emphasis on visuals and esthetics, as some scholars argue, leads users to focus  on sharing positive and even self-promotional content (e.g. Lup et al., 2015; Sheldon and  Bryant, 2016). 
In summary, Facebook presents a semi-public setting for which users’ networks  are typically composed of both strong and weak ties. These characteristics make it 
1818 new media & society 20(5) 
seemingly acceptable to express both negative and positive emotions, which research on  Facebook self-disclosures confirms (e.g. Moreno et al., 2011; Qiu et al., 2012). Twitter is  in comparison more public and used primarily to publish information and commentary  visible to weak ties. However, the short message feature appears to invite primarily nega 
tive commentary. Instagram is similar to Twitter in terms of its public setting and nonre ciprocal following. Its focus on visuals and aesthetics, contrarily, appears to make the  expression of positive emotions more conventional. WhatsApp can be characterized as a  private platform that is mainly used to interact with close friends and family (i.e. strong  ties), opening up the possibility for intimate conversation. The expression of emotion is  therefore expected to be considered most appropriate on WhatsApp compared to the  other social media platforms. Based on these characterizations, the following hypotheses  were put forward: 
H2. The perceived appropriateness of expressing negative emotions (i.e. sadness,  anger, disappointment, and worry) is higher for Facebook, followed by Twitter and  last Instagram. 
H3. The perceived appropriateness of expressing positive emotions (i.e. joy and pride)  is higher for Instagram, followed by Facebook, and last Twitter. 
H4. For WhatsApp, the perceived appropriateness of expressing both positive and  negative emotions is highest compared to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 
Differences for age and gender 
Gender and age may affect how one perceives the injunctive norms of emotion expres sion on social media platforms. Concerning age, younger people seem to disclose more  to peers than older people in both offline (Parker and Parrot, 1995) and online settings  (e.g. Christofides et al., 2012). In addition, younger users are more likely to post self derogating messages than older users (Bareket-Bojmel et al., 2016). Social media have  been argued to be especially suited for young people to practice self-disclosure  (Livingstone, 2008; Valkenburg and Peter, 2011), although other studies have not found  any age differences in self-expressions online (e.g. Taddicken, 2014). Due to inconclu sive evidence on this topic, it is difficult to predict age differences. However, younger  users may have different perceived norms compared to those that have been using online  communication for longer. We asked the following question: 
RQ1. How do late adolescents and emerging adults vary in their perceived appropri ateness of the six types of emotional self-expression across different social media  platforms? 
For gender, differences in disclosure behaviors have traditionally been attributed to  socialization processes. From an early age, girls are taught to be more expressive and  sensitive, while boys are expected to restrain from affective behaviors (e.g. Mesch and  Beker, 2010). Some studies have found that women use more affective words and express  more emotional content on social media, while men more often portray assertiveness and 
Waterloo et al. 1819 
serious expressions in their self-presentations (e.g. Tifferet and Vilnai-Yavetz, 2014).  However, other studies have failed to find gender differences in the context of disclosure  (e.g. Cho, 2007; Thelwall et al., 2010). Given these inconsistent results, we examine the  following research question: 
RQ2. How do males and females vary in their perceived appropriateness of the six  types of emotional self-expression across different social media platforms? 
Method 
Sample and procedure 
Participants were recruited through email from a subject pool of a professional research  company in March 2016. Institutional approval was granted prior to the collection of  data. Based on predetermined sample quota in terms of age (50% late adolescents, 50%  emerging adults) and gender (50% female, 50% male), 1201 individuals were surveyed.  The company reached out to a large number of subject pool participants from different  parts in the Netherlands that fit the quota and continued until the required number of  participants was met. A multistage randomization was employed by the company, mean 
ing that participants are first assigned to a series of profiling questions after which they  are randomly assigned to a survey based on their answers. Approximately, half of the  participants were between the ages of 15 and 18 years (n=591) and half between the ages  of 19 and 25years (n=610). In addition, 48.8% of the full sample was male, and 51.2%  was female. Individuals were only allowed to participate after actively granting consent,  which for the under-aged participants included parental consent as well. Participants  received monetary compensation after completion, in line with the research company’s  guidelines. 
Measures 
Platform use. Participants were presented with a list of 21 social media platforms, for  which they could indicate active use. Active use was defined as being a registered user  and having used the platform at least once in the past month, and primarily served as a  filter question for further questions. Participants were presented with statements for each  perceived norm of emotion expression separately for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and  WhatsApp. To avoid question order effects, the order in which the blocks of questions  for each platform were presented to participants was randomized. 
Perceived injunctive norms of positive emotion expression. Participants were asked to indi cate, per platform, to what extent they agreed with the statements “The people who are  important to me would be okay with me posting about something that made me joyous”  and “The people who are important to me would be okay with me posting about some thing that made me proud.” These items are based on the operationalization of personal  injunctive norms typically used in the literature on norms (e.g. Park and Smith, 2007). To  effectively measure perceived injunctive norms, items should focus on how participants 
1820 new media & society 20(5) 
perceive important others’ approval (i.e. “people who are important to me”) and on the  personal nature of the emotion expression of interest (i.e. “something that made me”).  Responses were measured using a five-point Likert-type scale (1=completely disagree to 5=completely agree). 
Perceived injunctive norms of negative emotion expression. The perceived appropriateness of  expressing negative emotions was measured in a similar manner to the perceived injunctive  norms of positive emotion expression, again separately for each platform. Participants indi cated on a five-point Likert-type scale (1=completely disagree to 5=completely agree) the  degree to which they agreed with the statement “The people who are important to me  would be okay with me posting about something that made me …,” which for the negative  emotions ended with the adjectives “sad,” “angry,” “disappointed,” or “worried.” 
Age and gender. Participants were asked to indicate their age through an open-ended  response format. This continuous variable was subsequently transformed into a dummy  variable, reflecting the age category corresponding to the age ranges of late adolescents  (15–18 years; coded as 0) and emerging adults (19–25years; coded as 1). In addition,  participants were asked whether they are male (coded as 0) or female (coded as 1). 
Covariates. To assess differences on a platform level, two covariates were included that  reflect possible individual variations related to one’s network. All covariates were meas ured separately per platform. An overview of the descriptive statistics for the covariates  and demographics are reported in Table 1. 
Perceived behavioral privacy. To understand how private (or public) participants per ceived different social media platforms, participants were presented with the following  situations: “Posting a message (status update) on your own Facebook Wall”; “Posting a  tweet that is shared with your list of followers on Twitter”; “Posting an image (including  a possible caption) on Instagram”; and “Sending a message to one other person through  WhatsApp.” Participants indicated to what extent they rated these situations as public or  private on a seven-point scale (1=very public to 7=very private). 
Privacy settings. Participants were asked to indicate whether the settings of their profile  and shared posts were either customized (i.e. visible only to a restricted set of accepted  network members; coded as 0) or set to the public default (i.e. visible to anyone on or off  the platform of concern; coded as 1). 
Analyses 
Factor analyses were used to test whether the perceived norms for negative emotions of  sadness, anger, disappointment, and worry were statistically distinct from the positive  emotions of joy and pride for each of the platforms. Principal component analyses using  direct oblimin rotation generated two components for Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram:  one for negative emotions and one for positive emotions (all primary loadings exceeded  .80; Cronbach’s alpha for negative emotions was higher than .92; Pearson’s r for positive 
Waterloo et al. 1821 
emotions was .85). For WhatsApp, only one component was extracted. However, when  the extraction of two factors was enforced, a similar pattern emerged. The correlation  between the two components for WhatsApp was relatively high (r=.69). Cronbach’s  alpha was .95 for the perceived norms of negative emotions, and the correlation for the  perceived norms of pride and joy was .87. Taking all perceived norms of negative emo 
tion expression for all social media platforms together revealed a Cronbach’s alpha of  .94, which for positive emotion expression was .88. 
To establish statistical differences between the means of perceived norms of emotion  expression for each platform, repeated measures analyses with a linear mixed models  approach were used. This approach accounts for the non-independence of residuals that  are a result of the multiple observations for each participant. The data were transformed  into long format in SPSS to allow for mixed modeling. The perceived norms were then,  separately, included as dependent variables with platform (four levels) as the repeated  factor. This approach is beneficial for analyzing data that includes missing data, since  subjects with missing data points will not be removed from the analyses (e.g. Bagiella  et al., 2000). In addition, the mixed models approach allows for fitting specific covari ance structures to the data. For the purpose of this study, compound symmetry was  selected, which treats all variances as approximately equal and all covariances as approx 
imately equal (Bagiella et al., 2000). This structure is commonly used if there is no logi cal ordering to the observations, which applies to the current data. We further applied the  Bonferroni adjustment within SPSS in comparing main effects to account for multiple  testing (Westfall et al., 1997), with alpha levels adjusted to .008 (=.05/6) per test. All  presented p-values are Bonferroni corrected. 
Results 
Descriptive statistics 
The majority of the sample (N=1201) indicated using WhatsApp (90.2%), followed by  Facebook (88.3%), Instagram (54.5%), and Twitter (34.6%). As shown in Table 1, the dis tribution of gender and age was approximately equal across all four platforms. In total,  participants indicated to use on average five platforms from the list of 21 social media  platforms (M=4.88, standard deviation [SD]=2.23). This average was significantly higher

for females (M=5.04, SD=2.25) compared to males (M=4.70, SD=2.19), t(1199)=−2.66,  p<.01. For age, this difference was not significant, t(1199)=1.01, p=.272. The significant correlations (see Table 2) with some of the perceived norms of emo tion expression across the four platforms show that privacy settings and perceived behav ioral privacy of platform context may be confounding factors. As individual privacy  settings may influence the extent to which one perceives a platform context to be public  or private, independent t-tests were conducted. These revealed that, except for WhatsApp  (t(1000)=1.89, p=.059), privacy settings lead to differences in the perceived behavioral  privacy of the platform context. That is, users with custom settings rated Facebook as  significantly more private (M=3.67, SD=1.79) than users with public settings (M=3.19,  SD=1.64, t(1058)=3.39, p=.001). This pattern also applied to Twitter (Mcustom =3.98,  SDcustom =1.87, Mpublic=2.96, SDpublic=1.70, t(414)=5.76, p<.001), and Instagram  (Mcustom =3.85, SDcustom =1.64, Mpublic=2.64, SDpublic=1.40, t(615)=10.14, p<.001). The  perceived behavioral privacy of platform context thus appears to differ for each privacy  setting, and is therefore included as a nested variable (i.e. within privacy setting) in the  mixed modeling analyses as a covariate. 
Emotion expression norms and platform differences 
Hypothesis 1 stated that, overall, expressions of positive emotions would be perceived as  more appropriate than expressions of negative emotions. The perceived appropriateness  of positive emotion expression was overall rated as higher (M=3.91, SD=.87) than the  perceived appropriateness of negative emotion expression (M=3.33, SD=.97). A paired  samples t-test revealed that this difference was statistically significant, t(3213)=35.13,  p<.001, thereby supporting Hypothesis 1. 
Hypotheses 2, 3, and 4 focused on the differences in the perceived appropriateness of  expressing emotions among Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The analyses  were performed for each individual emotion to gain a more thorough insight into the

patterns that possibly emerge. An overview of all the means and standard errors (SE) are  provided in Table 3. For the expression of sadness, the test of fixed effects showed a  significant influence of platform, F(3, 2420)=48.26, p<.001, as well as of perceived  behavioral privacy, F(2, 3090)=21.09, p<.001. Pairwise comparisons showed that the  expression of sadness was perceived as significantly more appropriate on WhatsApp  (M=3.66, SE=.04) than on all other platforms. The perceived appropriateness of  expressing sadness was lowest for Instagram (M=3.09, SE=.04) and Twitter (M=3.14,  SE=.05), which was significantly lower than for WhatsApp and Facebook (M=3.23,  SE=.03). For the expression of anger, the test of fixed effects also showed a significant  influence of platform, F(3, 2417)=47.26, p<.001, and perceived behavioral privacy,  F(2, 3098)=28.64, p<.001. Here, WhatsApp (M=3.64, SE=.04) again showed the  highest average rating of perceived appropriateness, and differed significantly from  Facebook (M=3.20, SE=.03), Twitter (M=3.26, SE=.05) and Instagram (M=3.07,  SE=.04) which showed the lowest average rating. The difference between Facebook and  Twitter, however, failed to reach significance. 
The perceived appropriateness of expressing disappointment was similarly affected  by platform, F(3, 2447) = 54.17, p < .001, as well as perceived behavioral privacy,  F(2, 3123) = 26.21, p < .001. The pairwise comparisons showed again that for  WhatsApp (M = 3.69, SE = .04) the expression of disappointment is perceived as most  appropriate, and significantly different from perceived appropriateness ratings for  Facebook (M = 3.24, SE = .03), Twitter (M = 3.25, SE = .05), and Instagram (M = 3.08,  SE = .04), again showing the lowest rating of perceived appropriateness. The differ 
ence in means between Facebook and Twitter was not significant. For the perceived  norm of expressing worry, the effect of platform was again significant, F(3,  2451) = 53.05, p < .001, as was the perceived behavioral privacy covariate, F(2,  3125) = 21.90, p < .001. Much like the expression of disappointment, the perceived  appropriateness of expressing worry was highest for WhatsApp (M = 3.74, SE = .04),  and significantly differed from Facebook (M = 3.27, SE = .03), Twitter (M = 3.29,  SE = .05), and Instagram (M = 3.15, SE = .04). The difference between Facebook and  Twitter did not reach significance.

Taken together, a consistent pattern emerges for the perceived appropriateness across  the different negative emotions. The ratings appeared highest for WhatsApp, followed by  both Facebook and Twitter, and lowest for Instagram. Facebook and Twitter were hypoth esized to significantly differ in means, which did not appear to be the case. However, the  data did confirm the overall hypothesized pattern between platforms. Therefore,  Hypothesis 2 was only partially supported. 
For the expression of positive emotions, the third Hypothesis predicted that Instagram  would show higher ratings of perceived appropriateness compared to Facebook, with  lowest ratings of perceived appropriateness for Twitter. The platform showed a signifi cant fixed effect on the perceived appropriateness ratings of joyous expressions, F(3,  2360)=10.89, p<.001, but not of the perceived behavioral privacy, F(2, 3022)=2.24,  p=.107. The perceived appropriateness of expressing joy was highest for WhatsApp  (M=4.05, SE=.03), followed by Instagram (M=3.93, SE=.03), Facebook (M=3.90,  SE=.03), and last Twitter (M=3.78, SE=.04). However, the mean differences between  Facebook and Instagram did not reach statistical significance. The perceived appropri 
ateness of expressing pride, was again significantly influenced by platform, F(3,  2405)=11.95, p<.001, as well as by the perceived behavioral privacy, F(2, 3078)=5.49,  p<.01. Ratings of perceived appropriateness were highest for WhatsApp (M=4.02,  SE=.03), followed by Instagram (M=3.89, SE=.04), Facebook (M=3.83, SE=.03), and  last Twitter (M=3.74, SE=.04). The mean difference between Facebook and Twitter, as  well as between Facebook and Instagram failed to reach significance. 
The perceived appropriateness of expressing positive emotions thus appeared higher for  both Instagram and Facebook compared to Twitter, which showed the lowest ratings of  perceived appropriateness. Again, the results did not support the hypothesized significant  differences between Instagram and Facebook. Hypothesis 3 was therefore only partially  supported. Finally, Hypothesis 4 posited that the expression of the positive as well as the  negative emotions would be considered most appropriate on WhatsApp. The results confirm  that WhatsApp, relative to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, had the highest ratings for all  positive and negative emotion expressions. Therefore, Hypothesis 4 was supported. 
Differences for age and gender 
To identify variations in perceived appropriateness of emotion expressions for age (RQ1)  and gender (RQ2), these variables were included in the repeated measures with mixed  modeling approach along with the covariate of perceived privacy of platform context  nested in privacy setting. The results revealed that there were no differences between late  adolescents (15–18 years) and emerging adults (19–25years) for the perceived appropri 
ateness of sadness, anger, disappointment, or worry. For the positive emotions, differ ences emerged only for the expression of joy on Instagram. Late adolescents (M=4.00,  SE=.05) considered the expression of joy more appropriate on Instagram than emerging  adults (M=3.82, SE=.05, t(3089)=2.71, p<.01). 
For gender, differences were primarily found for the expression of positive emotions  on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This indicates that females rated these expressions  as more appropriate than males (see Table 4). The expression of negative emotions on  each of these three platforms was largely viewed as equally appropriate by males and

females, with the exception of expressing worry on Facebook. For WhatsApp, females  rated the appropriateness of all expressions of emotion as more appropriate compared to  males. Females thus perceive the expression of positive emotions across different plat forms, as well as the expression of both positive and negative emotions in more private  spaces (i.e. WhatsApp), as more acceptable than males. 
Discussion 
This study mapped out the prevailing injunctive norms of emotion expression for different  platforms. More specifically, this study sought to identify the perceived appropriateness  
1826 new media & society 20(5) 
of six different expressions of emotions (i.e. sadness, anger, disappointment, worry, joy,  and pride) on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and WhatsApp. In doing so, the present find ings provide a snapshot of the possible variations in the prevailing perceived norms on  expressive behaviors across online spaces and further advance our understanding of self expression on social media. 
The expressions of positive emotions were generally considered more appropriate  than expressions of negative emotions across all platforms. This is in line with prior  research on the appropriateness of self-disclosure in offline contexts (e.g. Caltabiano and  Smithson, 1983), as well as the proportions of positively and negatively valenced mes 
sages found in online self-disclosure research so far (e.g. Lin et al., 2014). The expres sion of negative emotions may be perceived as less appropriate due to the intimacy it  carries (Chaikin and Derlega, 1974). In addition, we found differences in perceived  norms of emotion expression across platforms. The expression of all six emotions was  found to be most appropriate for WhatsApp relative to the other three more public plat forms. Our results thus correspond to theoretical and empirical work that has focused on  behavioral privacy in relation to self-disclosure (e.g. Bazarova, 2012). In addition, our  results also seem to be in line with studies on instant messaging that found intimate and  emotional experiences to be shared more often through these more private forms of com munication (e.g. Quan-Haase and Young, 2010). 
Concerning differences between the three more public platforms, our results only  partially confirmed the hypothesized patterns. The expression of negative emotions was  rated as more appropriate for Facebook and Twitter compared to Instagram. For positive  emotion expression, perceived appropriateness was higher for Instagram and Facebook  than for Twitter. This ties in with existing research that has pointed toward a focus on  self-promotional content on Instagram due to its visual properties (Sheldon and Bryant,  2016), and the popularity of negatively valenced content on Twitter (e.g. Naveed et al.,  2011). The features that are distinct for a social media platform thus seem to invite cer tain types of expressions and beliefs on what may be considered appropriate, beyond  differences in perceived behavioral privacy. 
To further understand normative patterns of online self-expression, age and gender  differences were also explored. Some gender differences were found, partially confirm ing that males find it less acceptable to share their feelings, as they rated the overall  expression of emotions as less appropriate on WhatsApp than females. Additionally,  males rated the expression of positive emotions as less appropriate on the other three  platforms relative to females, yet this was not the case for negative emotion expression.  This lends partial support to the theoretical understandings of gender differences in the  self-disclosure literature. While many studies on self-disclosure have failed to find gen der differences (e.g. Cho, 2007; Thelwall et al., 2010), this study provides a more nuanced  understanding by taking different platforms into consideration. Our findings suggest that  gender differences do not seem to manifest themselves equally across all social media  platforms, but particularly among private platforms that encourage more intimate emo tion expressions. 
The current results show that late adolescents and emerging adults generally do not  differ in their perceptions of appropriate emotional self-expression across the different  social media platforms. It is possible that these developmental processes have already 
Waterloo et al. 1827 
partly stabilized between the ages of 15 and 18 years, as young people nowadays engage  with social media at the young age of 10years (Lange, 2014). Additionally, parents now  more frequently discuss appropriate and inappropriate online behaviors with their teen age kids (Anderson, 2016), which more likely eliminates differences in behaviors  between adolescents and emerging adults through learned inhibitions. However, given  that the current data may suffer from selection bias, future research could further explore  whether these results hold in other samples of similar age ranges. 
Contributions and implications 
Ultimately, these findings show that users consider the expressions of both positive  and negative emotions acceptable on social media. Overall, this seems to fit the idea of  authentic self-presentation in online settings in that expressing negative emotions is  acceptable, which is in line with presenting one’s “true self” (e.g. Back et al., 2010;  Bareket-Bojmel et al., 2016). The relative higher rating of positive expression appro 
priateness points toward a stronger presence of positivity norms, which corresponds  with positive authenticity expectations on social media (Reinecke and Trepte, 2014).  However, this finding should not be considered unique to online settings as positivity  norms also persist in face-to-face interactions (Howell and Conway, 1990). Generally,  the fact that people follow rules of interaction stems from the inherent need to avoid  the risk of social sanctions and rejection (e.g. Cialdini and Trost, 1998; Lapinski and  Rimal, 2005). 
The current findings also provide further information on platform differences. More  private spaces in which one can communicate with a specific close friend allow for  looser norms of emotion expression, as our findings on WhatsApp showed. This finding,  along with the differences that emerged between the public platforms Twitter and  Instagram, might further explain why people hold multiple social media accounts and  shift between different platforms in expressing themselves. If users feel a need to express  themselves emotionally, they will likely select a platform for which they feel such  expressions will be deemed appropriate. Future research could further examine the per ceived appropriateness of emotion expression among populations from different coun 
tries, as uses of social media platforms and perceptions of appropriateness might be  country-specific or culturally dependent. 
Additionally, the expression of emotion in online settings remains a relatively  understudied subject. Norms are argued to be a driver of many social behaviors  (Lapinski and Rimal, 2005). The current results provide information on users’ percep tions of emotion expression on social media, thereby advancing theoretical knowledge  on the online sharing of emotion. Understanding what expressions are considered  appropriate and inappropriate could further be used to gain insight into what motivates  antinormative behaviors more accurately and the potential adverse consequences this  may have compared to normative behaviors of expression online. Research on prob lematic behaviors such as “flaming” has begun to explore the mechanisms that under lie these tendencies (Derks et al., 2008). However, not much is known about  antinormative behaviors related to emotion expression in online spaces and the conse quences thereof.

Future considerations 
The current findings need to be seen in light of the study’s limitations. First, we did not  study descriptive norms of emotion expression. Future research could consider this, as  the addition of descriptive norms may paint a more detailed picture of the current pre vailing norms of expression (Lapinski and Rimal, 2005). This study focused on the per ceived social punishments or rewards that may be imposed upon by important others,  who in the context of emotion expression would likely be most influential in guiding  such sensitive behavior. However, assessing which emotions participants perceive other  people to typically express, or whether participants would approve of important others’  emotion expressions on social media, is also relevant. Second, based on the current  results, it is not possible to single out exactly what features or affordances contributed to  the differences in perceived appropriateness across the four platforms studied. However,  we believe that the findings nevertheless provide new insights into differences in social  context between social media platforms which, given the dearth of comparative social  media research, marks a meaningful step toward a more informed perspective on plat form differences.
