Abstract 
Objectives Several types of epidemiologic studies sufer from decreasing participation rates, resulting in potential selection  bias and delay or termination of studies. We aimed to determine the feasibility of online methods for recruitment of pregnant  women into a prospective cohort study. Methods In addition to traditional recruitment through prenatal care providers, we  advertized participation in the PRegnancy and Infant DEvelopment (PRIDE) Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study  with long-term follow-up in The Netherlands enrolling women in early pregnancy, through Google AdWords (30 days) and  Facebook Ads (31 and 27 days) campaigns between September 2016 and January 2017. We calculated costs per eligible  participant and compared demographics, health-related characteristics, and follow-up rates between participants recruited  through online methods and prenatal care providers. Results During the study period, we recruited six women through  AdWords (€54.28 per participant), 59 through Facebook (€10.17 per participant), and 327 through prenatal care providers  (no valid cost estimate available). Facebook participants seemed to be younger (29.0 vs. 30.7 years), to have a higher body  mass-index and/or low/intermediate education (27.0 vs. 24.0 kg/m2 and 41 vs. 25%, respectively), and to start prenatal care  in secondary care more often (12 vs. 5%) than participants recruited through prenatal care providers. Item non-response  and loss to follow-up rates were higher among women recruited online than among those recruited through prenatal care  providers. Conclusion Google AdWords did not contribute substantially, but Facebook Ads may complement traditional  recruitment methods of pregnant women into prospective cohort studies, despite challenges that may threaten internal validity.

Introduction 
Recruitment of participants for health-related research is  becoming more and more challenging, with participation  rates gradually declining over the last decades (Morton  et al. 2006). In addition to the potential for biased results  due to selective participation in particularly case–control  studies, non-participation may cause delay or even early  termination of studies (Gul and Ali 2010). Indeed, 25%  of randomized clinical trials are discontinued, with poor  recruitment being the most frequently reported reason  (Kasenda et al. 2014). Cohort studies also sufer from  recruitment problems: the recent termination of two large  birth cohort studies, the National Children’s Study and the  UK Life Study (Reardon 2014; Pearson 2015), provides  an unfortunate example. Subjective experience of being  busy has been identifed as a reason for reduced research  participation (Vercruyssen et al. 2014). 
Traditionally, potential research participants have been  approached by a healthcare provider, either in person or  by mail or telephone, or through more general methods  such as mass mailings, random digit dialing, print media,  radio, and informal channels (e.g., word of mouth). With  the current high access rates to the Internet, online recruit 
ment ofers an alternative to these traditional methods.  A recent systematic review concluded that recruitment  through Facebook should be considered when conduct ing health-related research, but also identified some  limitations including overrepresentation of young white  women (Whitaker et al. 2017). Enrollment of pregnancy  planners and pregnant women in observational stud ies was evaluated in several previous studies (Richiardi  et al. 2012; Arcia 2014; Wise et al. 2015; Admon et al.  2016; Porucznik et al. 2016; Christensen et al. 2017), but  these studies either employed a cross-sectional design or  retention was not evaluated. In this study, however, we  assessed the feasibility of using Facebook advertisements  and Google AdWords for recruitment of pregnant women  into a prospective cohort study with long-term follow-up,  also focusing on retention rates when the study progressed.  We selected these two platforms because of their popular 
ity among the target population (van der Veer et al. 2018;  StatCounter Global Stats 2019). 
Methods 
Setting 
The PRegnancy and Infant DEvelopment (PRIDE) Study  is an ongoing prospective cohort study with long-term  
follow-up in the Netherlands aimed at identifying factors  that afect the health of the women and their children at  any point in time during or after pregnancy (van Gelder  et al. 2013). All Dutch pregnant women aged ≥ 18 years  with a gestational age< 17 weeks are eligible to partici 
pate. Data are primarily being collected through Web based questionnaires at baseline, in gestational weeks  17 and 34, 2 and 6 months after the estimated date of  delivery, and biannually throughout childhood. These  questionnaires focus on demographic characteristics,  obstetric history, maternal health, lifestyle factors, occu pational exposures, pregnancy outcome, and infant health.  Furthermore, we obtain consent for medical chart review.  The PRIDE Study was approved by the Regional Commit tee on Research Involving Human Subjects and informed  consent is obtained from all participants before inclusion  in the PRIDE Study. 
Recruitment Methods 
Recruitment for the PRIDE Study started in the Nijmegen  region in 2011 and was gradually expanded to become  nationwide in 2015. Initially, only participating midwives  and gynecologists invited pregnant women for participation  just before or during their frst prenatal care visit (usually  gestational weeks 8–12). Over 180 prenatal care providers  intended to recruit participants for the PRIDE Study, but in  reality, only approximately 30 midwifery practices actively  invited pregnant women for participation. Because of disap pointing low inclusion rates, alternative methods for recruit 
ment of study participants were explored. For example, we  exhibited the PRIDE Study at pregnancy fairs and started a  collaboration with ‘Moeders voor Moeders’ (Mothers for  Mothers). 
As a pilot, we also advertized the PRIDE Study online  through Google AdWords and Facebook Ads. For both  online methods, we evaluated diferent search terms (based  on the feedback given by the platforms) and applied search  engine optimization for the study website to keep the costs  per click as low as possible and to link to the search queries  of potential participants. With Google AdWords, a short  text advertisement that mimics the average search result  on Google is shown when selected search terms are used  (Online Resource). We used a set of 20 search terms related  to pregnancy with a cost-per-click ranging between €0.22  and €0.45 with a maximum of €10 ($ 11.36) per day. The  advertisement on Facebook was only shown to women aged  18–45 years living in The Netherlands with an interest in  pregnancy. We also paid per click with a maximum of €10  per day. The costs per click were based on an automated bid ding system (lowest cost bid strategy), which is the default  setting in Facebook Ads (Facebook Business 2019). The  advertisements used are shown in the Online Resource.

Maternal and Child Health Journal (2019) 23:1285–1291 1287 
After clicking on the advertisement, the person was redi rected to the PRIDE Study website for additional informa tion. Through this website, women could also sign up for  participation. We aimed to display advertisement campaigns  for 1 month: the AdWords campaign ran for 30 days in Sep tember–October 2016, the Facebook campaign for 31 days  and 27 days in October–November 2016 and January 2017,  respectively. The online recruitment strategies were stag gered to be able to evaluate recruitment through Google  AdWords and Facebook Ads separately. 
When signing up for participation, women indicated how  they learned about the PRIDE Study. For the current study,  we included all participants who were recruited through  their prenatal care provider, Google AdWords, or Facebook  Ads between September 19, 2016 and January 31, 2017 with  follow-up until November 30, 2017. Follow-up methods  were identical for the diferent recruitment methods and did  not change over the study period. 
Statistical Analysis 
For the online recruitment methods, we extracted the num ber of total impressions (times the advertisement was shown  on the website), total clicks, click-through rates (number of  clicks divided by number of impressions), costs per click,  and total costs from Google AdWords and Facebook Ads.  The average numbers of impressions and clicks per day were  obtained by dividing the total impressions and total clicks by  the number of campaign days. We calculated the costs per  enrolled participant by dividing the total costs per online  
Table 1 Recruitment results

recruitment method by the number of participants recruited  through that method. 
We compared participants recruited through prenatal care  providers with women recruited through online recruitment  methods for age at enrollment, country of birth, educational  level, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) based on self 
reported height and weight, gravidity, parity, smoking and  alcohol consumption during pregnancy, type of prenatal care  provider, and gestational age at enrollment. Furthermore,  we compared pregnancy outcome between these groups  of participants, with missing values as a proxy for loss to  follow-up. These data were obtained from the PRIDE Study  questionnaires administered during pregnancy (miscarriage/ stillbirth or termination of pregnancy) and 2 months after  the estimated date of delivery (live-born infant or stillbirth).  Consequently, all women who did not complete the post-par 
tum questionnaire and did not report an adverse pregnancy  outcome in the prenatal questionnaires were considered lost  to follow-up. All statistical analyses were performed using  IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22 (IBM Corp.,  Armonk, NY). 
Results 
A total of 327 participants were recruited through prena tal care providers during the study period. The Google  AdWords campaign generated 34,325 impressions and 865  clicks (click-through rate 2.52%); total costs were €325.66  (Table 1).

book Ads campaign in January 2017 generated 131,142  impressions and 5244 clicks (click-through rate 4.00%,  total costs €284.48), resulting in 59 women signing up for  participation and 30 eligible participants. Of the 19 women  ineligible for participation in the 3 campaigns combined, 18  had a gestational age≥17 weeks and 1 was<18 years of age.  The costs per eligible participant for Google AdWords and  Facebook Ads were €54.28 ($61.67) and €10.17 ($11.55),  respectively. 
The characteristics of the PRIDE Study participants  recruited through prenatal care providers and Face book are shown in Table 2. The six women recruited via  Google AdWords were not included in this comparison.  Although based on small numbers, participants recruited  through Facebook seemed to be slightly younger (29.0 vs.  30.7 years), and had a higher pre-pregnancy BMI (27.0 vs.  24.0 kg/m2), whereas larger proportions seemed to have low/ intermediate education (41 vs. 25%) and to start prenatal  care in a secondary care setting (12 vs. 5%) compared to  participants recruited through prenatal care providers. We  did not observe substantial diferences (>5%) in the other  demographic and health-related characteristics between the  participants recruited through prenatal care providers and  participants recruited through Facebook. 
Compared to women recruited through prenatal care pro viders, however, women recruited through Facebook more  often did not complete the questions on country of birth,  level of education, and smoking and alcohol consump tion during pregnancy. Furthermore, participants recruited  through both online methods were more often lost to fol low-up compared to women recruited through prenatal care  providers, as refected in the higher rates of missing infor mation on pregnancy outcome for Google AdWords (50%)  and Facebook (34%) than for prenatal care providers (25%). 
Discussion 
Our fndings indicate that Facebook Ads outperform Google  AdWords for recruiting pregnant women into a prospective  cohort study with long-term follow-up with regard to the  total number of participants enrolled and the costs per eli 
gible participant. Participants recruited through Facebook  seemed to be slightly younger, more likely to have a lower  level of education and a higher pre-pregnancy BMI, and  more likely to start prenatal care in a secondary care set 
ting than women recruited through prenatal care providers.  However, item non-response and loss to follow-up rates were

higher among women recruited through online methods  compared to recruitment through prenatal care providers. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the frst attempt  to evaluate recruitment of pregnant women for research  purposes using Google AdWords. Therefore, we can only  hypothesize about the reasons why this online method did  not work as well as Facebook Ads. Most likely, reaching  the target population is much harder with Google AdWords,  as it is impossible to use demographic characteristics and

other background information Facebook collected from its  users to select the people to which the advertisement is being  shown (targeted approach). Recruitment of pregnancy plan ners and pregnant women into observational studies through  Facebook, however, was evaluated in several previous stud ies with mixed results: click-through rates ranged between  0.03 and 2.74% (current study: 3.85%), whereas the costs per  recruited woman ranged between €3.44 ($3.91) and $33.31  (€29.32) (current study: €10.17) (Richiardi et al. 2012;  Arcia 2014; Wise et al. 2015; Admon et al. 2016; Poruc znik et al. 2016; Christensen et al. 2017). Also, the number  of women recruited through this social media platform dif fered strongly depending on the budget spent. Assuming a  continuous (linear) fow of participants recruited through  Facebook with a budget of €10 per day, this method may still  have yielded fewer participants (N =137) compared with  recruitment through prenatal care providers (N=327) over  the study period of 135 days. Increasing the daily budget  for Facebook Ads may boost the number of participants to  a level similar to or exceeding healthcare provider-based  recruitment, but no studies on the optimal budget settings  have been performed yet. 
As study participants in general and hard-to-reach sub groups, such as pregnant women, in particular are challeng ing to recruit nowadays, targeted Facebook advertisements  seem to gain popularity as a new method of recruitment for  both observational (Arcia 2014; Harris et al. 2015; Admon  et al. 2016; Christensen et al. 2017; Fonseca and Cana varro 2017; Motoki et al. 2017; Jordan et al. 2018; Kerns  et al. 2018; Mengesha et al. 2018) and experimental studies  (Adam et al. 2016; Laws et al. 2016) within maternal and  child health research. In other research areas, for example  studies among men who have sex with men (Lachowsky  et al. 2016; Buckingham et al. 2017), parents (Tustin et al.  2017; Oesterle et al. 2018), and cancer survivors (Juraschek  et al. 2018; Tsai et al. 2019), online recruitment methods  are also being applied successfully. However, Williamson  et al. (2018) failed to recruit pregnant women with asthma  through Facebook and Twitter and pointed to the possibility  of publication bias in the literature on online recruitment  methods. 
Similarly to previous studies on the recruitment of preg nancy planners or pregnant women through Facebook,  online recruitment for the PRIDE Study yielded a more  diverse sample of pregnant women compared to health care provider-based recruitment, particularly with regard to  maternal age (Arcia 2014), level of education (Admon et al.  2016), and gestational age at enrollment (Adam et al. 2016;  Admon et al. 2016). Although these difering characteris tics may yield advantages, online recruitment has also been  criticized as the characteristics of women with and without  Internet or Facebook in particular may difer. However, pre vious studies showed that this form of self-selection does  
not necessarily lead to biased measures of associations in  prospective cohort studies (Nohr et al. 2006; Nilsen et al.  2009; Hatch et al. 2016). 
We identifed only two studies that reported on reten tion rates after online recruitment, varying between 43%  at 6–8 weeks follow-up for Australian parents and 78%  at 1 month follow-up for young veterans (Pedersen et al.  2017; Bennetts et al. 2019). In our study, retention seemed  lower among women recruited through Facebook (66%)  than among women recruited through prenatal care provid ers (75%), which may lead to selection bias caused by dif ferential loss to follow-up (informative censoring) (Hernán  et al. 2004). This issue represents a threat to the internal  validity of efect estimates derived from cohort studies.  Although statistical techniques, such as inverse probability of-censoring weighted estimation and stratifcation-based  methods can correct for selection bias due to loss to follow up (Howe et al. 2016), methods to improve retention in Web based cohorts should be developed to prevent this type of  bias, irrespective of the method of recruitment. 
Limitations of the current study include the relatively  small numbers of subjects enrolled through online methods,  the diference in time period between the three methods of  recruitment, and lack of a valid cost estimate for participants  recruited through prenatal care providers as we do not have  insight into the number of study leafets (€0.05 each) dis 
tributed during the study period. Based on a previous study  (Bonde et al. 1998), we estimated that it takes 120 study  leafets to include one participant (€6.00 per participant). 
In conclusion, recruitment of women early in pregnancy  into a prospective cohort study with long-term follow-up  through Facebook Ads is feasible and may improve partici pation among typically underrepresented populations, such  as women with a low level of education. However, online  recruitment also results in lower follow-up rates compared  to recruitment through prenatal care providers. Google  AdWords did not contribute substantially to the recruitment  of pregnant women into the PRIDE Study.
