‘‘They Are Happier and Having Better Lives than I Am’’: The Impact of Using Facebook 
on Perceptions of Others’ Lives 
Hui-Tzu Grace Chou, Ph.D., and Nicholas Edge, B.S. 
Abstract 
Facebook, as one of the most popular social networking sites among college students, provides a platform for  
.
people to manage others’ impressions of them. People tend to present themselves in a favorable way on their 
y
l
n
Facebook profile. This research examines the impact of using Facebook on people’s perceptions of others’ lives. It 
o
 
e
s
u
is argued that those with deeper involvement with Facebook will have different perceptions of others than those 
 
l
a
n
less involved due to two reasons. First, Facebook users tend to base judgment on examples easily recalled (the 
o
s
r
e
availability heuristic). Second, Facebook users tend to attribute the positive content presented on Facebook to 
p
 
r
o
others’ personality, rather than situational factors (correspondence bias), especially for those they do not know

communication, social interactions can take place beyond face-to-face. Computer-mediated communication differs from face-to-face communication in that it eliminates many of the subtle cues that people use to form their impressions of others. Without these subtle cues, will the impressions formed online differ from those formed through face-to-face interaction? This research aims to answer this question by examining some perceptions of Facebook users. 
Previous research has found that users of computer mediated communication can employ several techniques to optimize their self-presentation and promote desired rela tionships, such as spending more time with greater cognitive resources to edit the messages,6 carefully selecting photo graphs,7 highlighting their positive attributes,7 presenting an ideal self,7 having a deeper self-disclosure,8 managing the 
users of computer-mediated communication can leave better impressions on others. 
One feature of Facebook is that it enables users to present themselves in an online profile with pictures and life events that they would like to share with those listed as their Face book friends. Although comments posted by others cannot be controlled, Facebook users can still select whom they will allow to be Facebook friends; thus they can indirectly control the comments. Previous research has found that Facebook has affected the lives of its users, as well as their self perceptions. For example, it can help users maintain or create social capital,14–16 facilitate civic and political participation,17 motivate students and establish a higher-level affective learning classroom climate,18 and increase users’ self-esteem with positive comments posted by their Facebook friends.19 Research also has found some negative impacts of Facebook. For example, Facebook can cause jealousy issues in romantic

relationships20 and decrease teachers’ credibility;18 users’ self-esteem might be negatively affected by including strangers on Facebook,21 or by receiving negative comments posted on their Facebook page.19 In addition, people’s Face book profiles affect others’ impression toward them. Previous studies found that comments posted by users’ Facebook friends,13 as well as the number of Facebook friends22 and the attractiveness of Facebook friends,13 affect others’ impression of users’ popularity or social attractiveness. Building on previous research that has examined the impact of Facebook on users’ self-perceptions and others’ perceptions toward them, this study fills a research gap by examining the impact of Facebook on users’ perceptions toward others. 
Theoretical Arguments and Hypotheses 
It is argued here that Facebook users tend to employ some heuristics when they form impressions of others, especially those whom they do not know personally. First, Facebook deprives its users from observing their online partners’ non verbal expressions, thus compelling users to rely only on the 
 
.
y
l
information they can get online. Second, Facebook social net 
n
o
 
e
works grow faster than real-life social networks; therefore, it 
s
u
 
l
becomes nearly impossible for its users to interact closely with 
a
n
o
s
each of their network friends. Previous research found that an 
r
e
p
average Facebook user has 217 network members,21 while the 
 
r

average size of a real-life social network is expected to be

around 125.23 With the rapid expansion of their online social

before, online users tend to become cognitive misers.24–26 
a

One possible way to manage the vast size of online social

networks is to employ an availability heuristic; that is, indi 
u
p
t
r
viduals can base judgment on examples that they can easily

recall.27,28 When forming impressions of others, it is easy for 
i
l
.
w
frequent Facebook users to recall the statements and pictures 
w

posted by their Facebook friends. Since people are motivated

o
l
n
happy and have good lives. In contrast to their own life 
w

D
events, which might not always be happy and positive, frequent Facebook users might perceive that life is not fair. Although Facebook users are all prone to employ the avail ability heuristic, heavy Facebook users have more available examples from Facebook; thus they are more vulnerable to a distorted perception. 
When making judgments or forming impressions about others, one common attribution error is the correspondence bias; that is, the tendency to assume that others’ actions and words reflect their personality or stable personal disposition, rather than being affected by situational factors.29–32 When seeing others’ happy pictures posted on Facebook, users might conclude that others are happy, while ignoring the circumstances or situations that made others happy. The correspondence bias is more likely to happen when Facebook users make attributions about people whom they have never met before. They assume that happiness is a stable charac teristic of their temperaments and that they are constantly enjoying good lives. For those they do know personally, however, their past interactions with them help Facebook 
users avoid the trap of correspondence bias and recognize the external factors at work: it is the occasions that make their friends happy. Based on the research and arguments above, the following two hypotheses are formulated: 
H1: Those who are more involved with using Facebook are more likely to perceive that others are happier and are having better lives, and are less likely to agree that life is fair (availability heuristic). 
H2: Those who include more strangers on their Facebook are more likely to perceive that others are happier and are having better lives, and are less likely to agree that life is fair (cor respondence bias). 
Data Collection 
To test the hypotheses, a questionnaire that included the three perceptions—others have a better life, others are happier, and life is fair—was developed. The respondents were 425 under graduate students taking classes at a large state university in Utah between the fall of 2010 and spring of 2011 across various academic disciplines, including sociology, psychology, math ematics, social work, family study, chemistry, criminal justice, graphic design, astronomy, accounting, and dance. The in structors of these randomly chosen classes were contacted first by e-mail. Appointments were then made to collect the sur veys from their students during their class period, except for two online classes where surveys were collected online. 
Dependent variables 
Respondents were asked, ‘‘How much would you agree with the following statements? Many of my friends have a better life than me; many of my friends are happier than me; life is fair,’’ with 1 indicating ‘‘strongly disagree’’ and 10 in dicating ‘‘strongly agree.’’ The means of the two statements were 3.86 and 3.89, while the mean of the third statement was 5.93. In other words, most respondents tended to disagree that others have better lives and others are happier, and tend to believe that life is fair, which is consistent with the better than-average effect.33,34 
Independent variables 
This research uses ‘‘years of using Facebook’’ and ‘‘number of hours spent on Facebook each week.’’ ‘‘Years of using Facebook’’ can indicate the experiences users have with Facebook, whereas ‘‘number of hours spent on Facebook each week’’ can indicate the degree of current involvement with the Facebook. When respondents were asked, ‘‘Have you ever used Facebook?,’’ about 95% of them (400 out of 425 respondents) answered yes, while 5% (22 out of 425 respon dents) answered no. Among Facebook users, the average number of years using Facebook was 2.55, and the average number of hours spent on Facebook each week was 4.83. The means and standard deviations of all variables used in the multivariate analysis are presented in the Appendix. 
Data Analysis 
The results of the multiple regression analysis of the three perceptions others have a better life, others are happier, and life is fair are presented in Table 1. After controlling for religiosity, gender, and relationship status, the results show that those

Discussion and Conclusions 
a

The results of this research support the argument that using

D
Facebook affects people’s perceptions of others. For those that have used Facebook longer, it is easier to remember positive messages and happy pictures posted on Facebook; these readily available examples give users an impression that others are happier. As expected in the first hypothesis, the results show that the longer people have used Facebook, the stronger was their belief that others were happier than themselves, and the less they agreed that life is fair. Furthermore, as predicted in the second hypothesis, this research found that the more ‘‘friends’’ people included on their Facebook whom they did not know personally, the stronger they believed that others had better lives than themselves. In other words, looking at happy pictures of others on Facebook gives people an im pression that others are ‘‘always’’ happy and having good lives, as evident from these pictures of happy moments. In contrast to their own experiences of life events, which are not always positive, people are very likely to conclude that others have better lives than themselves and that life is not fair. The correspondence bias is more likely to occur when people make inferences about people whom they do not know well. They 
tend to perceive that others are constantly happy, while paying little attention to the circumstances that affect others’ behavior. One could argue that frequent Facebook users shall know the tricks others use to manage the impression; therefore, experienced Facebook users could avoid the potential dis torted perception. However, the results of the research sug gest that frequent Facebook users tend to perceive that others are happier. In other words, they are more likely to be af fected by the easily recalled content and tend to have the correspondence bias, whether consciously or unconsciously. The problems of relying on an availability heuristic and having correspondence bias can be alleviated by having more balanced information, which can be gained through deeper interactions with others. The results of this research found that the more time people spent going out with their friends, the less they agreed that others have better lives and are happier. In other words, when people have more off-line in teractions with their friends, knowing more stories about others’ lives, both positive and negative, they are less per suaded that others are happier than themselves. In this way, they can avoid correspondence bias. Since becoming ‘‘Face book friends’’ usually starts with two people knowing each other in person, it follows that those with more friends on their Facebook tend to have a more balanced view of others because they know more people in person. Therefore, they are more likely to agree that life is fair, and less likely to agree that others are happier, as the results of this research indi cated.
