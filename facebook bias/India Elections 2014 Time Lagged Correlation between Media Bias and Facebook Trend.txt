Abstract- After establishing print media bias and Facebook trend as reliable predictors of election  outcome, the study analyses the relationship between the two before and during the 2014 Indian  Lok Sabha election. Time-lagged correlation is used to study the immediate effect of newspaper  reports on the political behaviour of Facebook. Further, a correlation was found to exist between  the long-term political trends in the print media and Facebook. That is, the number of positive  and negative news reports published on a party in the newspapers affected the number of ‘likes’  recorded on the Facebook fan page of the party or its candidate.

I. INTRODUCTION 
M  
edia effect on the masses is an intensely studied area of communications research, but  the relationship that exists between different  
media platforms and they way they interact and  influence each other have been barely explored. Print  media remains to be a main source of political  information in India and it also influences voter decisions  (Chiang and Knight, 2011). On the other hand, the  online social media has become a tool for free  expression of political opinion—its content being user  generated (Woolley, et al., 2010). Hence, it can be  consciously and cautiously assumed that print media  behaviour could affect the political trend observed on  online social media. To test this theory in the context of  the 2014 Indian Parliamentary election, four leading  English newspapers and Facebook were chosen.  
Perhaps, India’s 2014 general election was the  world’s largest democratic exercise—with about 814.5  million eligible voters—conducted in nine phases from  April 7 till May 12, 2014. The Indian National Congress  (INC or just the Congress), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)  and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) were the dominant  parties contesting the election. Arvind Kejriwal led the  AAP, while Rahul Gandhi, son of former Prime Minister  Rajiv Gandhi and Congress President Sonia Gandhi,  was portrayed as the face of INC. BJP nominated  Narendra Damodardas Modi as its prime ministerial  candidate, who led his party to a thumbing victory.

While the Congress party secured 106,935,311  (19.3%) votes, the BJP amassed 171,637,684 (31%).  AAP managed a meagre 11,325,635. 
Both the mainstream print and the online social  media played decisive roles during the election period,  spreading political news and moulding public opinion  (Pansare, 2014; and Swamy, 2014). In India,  newspapers are witnessing steady growth in circulation  numbers bucking the global trend (Hooke, 2012). India  is home to the world’s largest English-language  newspaper readership (Hayden, 2012) and the fastest  growing newspaper market (The Economist, 2011, and  All About Newspapers, 2010). This apart, India recorded  the fastest Facebook growth in 2014 (PTI, 2014).  Facebook announced on March 31, 2014, that its Indian  user base had just crossed the 100-million milestone  (Singh, 2014).  
As the circulation of newspapers and the  number of Facebook users increase, their influence on  the electorate is only amplified. Hence, it becomes  important to study their political behaviour during  elections. Accordingly, the aim of the present study is  stated to be:  
To identify the political trends that prevailed in the print  media and Facebook during the period of study— January 24 to May 12, 2014. 
To validate those political trends by correlating them  with the election results.  
To associate the political trends by correlating them with  each other.  
For the present study, the top four English  newspapers published from India—readership wise— were chosen. By content analysing the newspapers, the  political trend that prevailed during the study period can  be estimated using time-series analysis.  
Similarly, the top national parties chosen for the  study were the Congress, BJP and AAP, as the  prospects of others claiming a majority at the Centre  were bleak. 
Political influence of print media: Bartels (1993)  analysed the persuasive effects of media exposure and  concluded that new information absorbed via media  exposure must be about three times as distinctive as  has generally been supposed in order to account for  observed patterns of opinion change. Rhee (1997)  found that news frames in election coverage affected  individuals' interpretation of campaigns. Druckman and

India Elections 2014: Time-Lagged Correlation between Media Bias and Facebook Trend 
Parkin (2005) investigated how editorial slant—defined  as the quantity and tone of a newspaper’s candidate  coverage as influenced by its editorial position—shaped  candidate evaluations and vote choice. Combining  comprehensive content analyses of the papers with an  Election Day exit poll, the researchers assessed the  slant of campaign coverage and its effects on voters.  The researchers claimed to have found compelling  evidence that editorial slant affected electoral decisions.  Exposure to newspapers affects political behaviour and  opinion (Gerber, et al., 2006). Kuypers (2002) charted  the potential effects that the press has upon the  messages of political and social leaders when they  
5 
1
discuss controversial issues. Endersby (2011) observed

that news consumers who read papers are more likely  
r 
a
to modify their perceptions of party ideology in the  e
Y
direction of press bias. Furthermore, media  30 
consumption correlated with ideological preferences  and perceptions of political parties. Reviewing the past    
studies, it can be cautiously assumed that the print

media could exhibit bias in their election coverage—and  
o
i
s
thereby, influence the voters.

Kushin and Kitchener (2009) studied the emergence of  
o
l
Facebook as a platform for political discourse and  G
raised new questions for study of online political  discussion as it occurred in the emergent Internet  technologies of social network sites. 
Vitak (2011) observed that in the 2008 US  presidential election, social network sites such as  Facebook allowed users to share their political beliefs,  support specific candidates and interact with others on  political issues. The researchers also found evidence  
© 2015 Global Journals Inc. (US) 
that political activities on Facebook affected political  participation among young voters. 
Reviewing the past studies, it can be inferred  that various aspects of Facebook and political  communication happening on the social network has  been studied and the online social network is  recognised as a crucial tool for propaganda and political  deliberation. However, using the number of ‘likes’  recorded on Facebook fan pages and predicting  election outcomes have not been studied, at least, in the  studies reviewed. Facebook, like a few other online  platforms, offers users the power to freely express their  political opinion. The present study uses the count of  ‘likes’ recorded on the Facebook fan pages of  ‘Narendra Modi’, ‘Arvind Kejriwal’ and ‘Indian National  Congress’ during the study period to trace the political  trend of Facebook. 
Furthermore, time—that is an important aspect  of communication—has been ignored in the past  studies. But the present study employs reliable  methodologies to study the political trends in the print  media and on Facebook, and track their shift over time.  
On Facebook, the number of ‘likes’ recorded on the fan  pages of the politicians can help estimate the political  trend prevailing on the social network. But for the  newspapers, the political polarity of each of the political  news items published on the three parties—that is,  whether it is favourable, unfavourable or neutral—and  their position in the papers—that is, on which page, the  news items were published—have to be considered to  track the political trend.  
a) Research questions 
At this stage, to bring in some focus to the  study, the following research questions are asked:  
RQ1. Do the newspapers show a particular partisan  political orientation?  
RQ2. Is the political trend in the papers associated with  the election results? 
RQ3. Which political party is popular on Facebook and  to what extent?  
RQ4. Is Facebook popularity associated with the  election results? 
RQ5. Is the press trend associated with the Facebook  popularity? 
b) Hypotheses for the newspapers 
Press popularity can be defined in many ways.  Even the number of mentions of a party name could be  used to estimate popularity. But the present study is  focussed on studying latent content rather than manifest  content as the former is considered more meaningful.  Since, the study considers the political polarities of  political news items and their respective positions in the  paper, the following hypothesis is proposed for the  newspapers: 
India Elections 2014: Time-Lagged Correlation between Media Bias and Facebook Trend 
More number of strategically-positioned positive  reports on a party in the newspapers means more votes for that party in the election. 
This hypothesis takes into account only the  positive reports published on a particular party.  Newspapers publish both positive and negative reports  and hence, another hypothesis is proposed to take into  account the negative reports as well: 
More number of strategically-positioned positive  reports and comparatively lesser number of  strategically-positioned negative reports on a party in  the newspapers means more votes for that party in the  election. This hypothesis could be simplified by  introducing a term ‘positivity’ which will stand for  ‘strategically-positioned positive reports and  comparatively lesser strategically-positioned negative  reports’ as: More positivity for a party in the newspapers  means more votes for that party in the election. 
Testing this hypothesis will answer RQ1 and RQ2. 
c) Hypotheses for Facebook  
On Facebook, leaders of two of the three  chosen parties had verified fan pages. However, for the  other party, the fan page of the party was taken into  account for analysis. The number of ‘likes’ recorded on  the fan pages of the representative of the parties were  more than that of the party, which means, the leaders  were more popular that their respective parties on social  media.  
Hence, the hypothesis for Facebook would be: More number of ‘likes’ recorded on the fan  page of a party or the representative of the party means  more votes for that party in the election. 
Likes are termed positive. However, the number  of ‘likes’ keeps adding up. At the start of the study, the  parties had different number of ‘likes’ and hence,  calculations based on them could be erratic. Hence, to  track the actual political trend on Facebook, the number  of new ‘likes’ recorded every day was taken into  account. For that analysis, the hypothesis is as follows: 
More number of new ‘likes’ recorded on the fan  page of a party or the representative of the party means  more votes for that party in the election. 
Testing this hypothesis will answer RQ 3 and RQ 4. 
d) Hypotheses for print media-Facebook association The above-mentioned hypotheses identify the  political trends that prevailed in the print media and  Facebook during the period of study and validate them.  But the present study also seeks to analyse short- and  long-term effects of the print media on the people and  Facebook by comparing the content of newspapers with  that of the online social network. People are the  connection between mass media and the online social  media. So, if the trends and shocks observed in the  press is reflected and felt on the online social media  then the amount of influence that these media exert on  
the people and vice-versa can be deduced. Hence, the  following hypothesis is proposed to infer and check the  effects of the print media: 
More positivity for a party in the newspapers  means more number of new ‘likes’ recorded on the fan  page of a party or the representative of the party. 
After the hypotheses are proposed, the next  step would be to choose appropriate methods of  research. The method of research chosen is explained  in the following chapter.  
II. METHOD OF RESEARCH 
a) Newspapers

Based on readership figures, the following  2
broadsheet dailies were selected for the study: The 
r 
a
Times of India (ToI), Hindustan Times (HT), The Hindu 
e
Y
(TH) and The Telegraph (TT). Political news items  31 
published in the chosen four newspapers were collected  on a daily-basis from January 24 to May 12, 2014— the  
  
I
period of study. In this study, ‘news item’ refers to news  
 
n
stories, editorials, op-ed pieces, columns, standalone  
o
i
s
r
pictures, info-graphics and opinion pieces published in  
e
V
the newspapers. The unit of analysis is a news item. Of  
 
I
I
the news items published, the ones that were related to  
 
e
the chosen parties—the Congress, BJP and AAP—were  
u
s
s
I
segregated.  
 
Each of the items was analysed and classified  
V
X
as positive, neutral or negative for a party based on its  
 
e
content. A common formula was applied to each of the  
m
u
l
news item in this comparative study to mitigate any  
o
V
inherent bias in the data analysis.

A
Scoring guidelines for polarity: Nine categories were  
( 
 
  
chosen for categorisation of political polarity—Congress  
e
c
positive, Congress negative and Congress neutral; BJP  
n
e
i
positive, BJP negative and BJP neutral; AAP positive,  
c
S
 
AAP negative and AAP neutral. While reporting an issue  
l
a
i
or controversy, if a news item presented the view or  
c
o
- 
statement of a party or the views that favour that party,  
S
 
n
then the news item was classified as positive for that  a
m
party.  
u
In the case of multiple views, the dominant view  
H
 
f
was considered.  
o
 
l
If a news item had the mention of a party and  
a
n
r
was found to be damaging the image of that party, it  u
o
was rated as negative. If a news item was based on the  
J
 
l
political campaign of a party, then it was classified as  
a
b
positive for that party. Positive and negative statements  
o
l
were tracked in news reports to decide their polarity. If a  G
news item mentions more than one party, then the party  that is dominantly discussed in the news report is  considered.  
A news item that did not exhibit a perceivable  political polarity was categorised as neutral. Only the news items that exhibited a political polarity—that is,  either positive or negative—were considered for further  analysis of political orientation of the newspapers.

Scoring guidelines for position: Based on the position of  the news item in the paper—that is on which page it  appeared— weightage was assigned to it. Front page  news item - 5; editorial - 4; news item on editorial or op 
ed page - 3 and news item on nation page - 2.  
Independent variables in this study are  newspaper, party and ‘time’, while the dependent  variables are political polarity and the position of news  items in the paper, which were measured in ratio points.  Political orientation of a newspaper was calculated  based on the two dependent variables. Calculation was  done daily to track the trend over time as the four  papers analysed are daily broadsheets. For the

The unit of analysis is a ‘like’. The number of

during the day. However, the number of ‘likes’ on each  
J
 
l
of the fan pages was recorded at the same time during  
a
b
a day to mitigate bias and inter-subjectivity. Since a ‘like’  
o
l
carries a positive character and there was not a negative  G
equivalent to it on Facebook, the number of ‘likes’ was  only used to understand the political trend on Facebook. Independent variables are party and ‘time’, while the  dependent variable is ‘like’, which were measured in  ratio points. Political trend that prevailed on Facebook  was deduced using the counts of ‘likes’ that were  recorded on each of the chosen fan pages. It was  recorded daily to track the trend over time. For the  
© 2015 Global Journals Inc. (US) 
independent variable time, the unit of measurement was  one day. Political trends were calculated for the whole  study period to conclude which party was favoured and  to what extent on Facebook. The political trend of  Facebook was determined using the number of actual  ‘likes’ and the number of new ‘likes’ recorded on the fan  pages. 
The data were collected and analysed using  Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and a portable version of  the SPSS statistics software. For the time-series  analyses, linear and quadratic regression models and  SPSS Expert Modeler were employed. 
III. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION 
RQ1. Do the newspapers show a particular partisan  political orientation? 
Political news published in the four chosen  newspapers—The Times of India, Hindustan Times, The  Hindu and The Telegraph—were reviewed on a daily  basis during the period of study—January 24 to May 12,  2014. Of them, the political news items published on the  front page, editorial page, Op-ed page and nation  pages on the three national parties selected for the  study were rated as positive and negative for a party.  That was identified as the political polarity of a news  item. Based on the news item’s position in the paper— that is, on which page it was published—each news  item was assigned a weightage. Daily scores for the  papers were calculated by summing up the weightages  of the positive and negative news items. The first part of  the analysis deals with finding out the political  orientations of the four newspapers—that is, which  newspaper supported which political party and to what  extent. 
a) One-way Anova: Party vs Positivity 
To determine the political orientation of the  newspapers, the political polarities identified in its  reports with the position weightage attributed to each of  the polarity were summed up for the whole study period.  Then the negative scores were subtracted from the  positive scores to get the positivity scores, which were  used to define the political orientation of the  newspapers.  
One-way Anova was performed to find out if  there were statistically significant differences among the  three chosen parties with regard to the positivity scores  that each of them earned in the daily newspapers during  the study period and the results are presented in Table1.

There was a statistically significant difference  among the parties with regard to their average positivity  scores as determined by one-way Anova (p < .0005). A  Tukey post-hoc test revealed the political orientations of  the newspapers (BJP-21.44; Congress-15.66 and AAP 
6.55) were in favour of the BJP, see Table 2. The Aam Aadmi Party drew the least amount of support from the  newspapers—that is, it saw the least number of  favourable news reports.

A Spearman’s rank-order correlation was run to  determine the relationship between the political trend on  the newspapers and election results. There was a  strong, positive correlation between them, which was  statistically significant (rs = 1.000, p < .01). 
Hence, the hypothesis that more positivity for a  party in the newspapers means more votes for that party  in the election is tenable. 
RQ3. Which political leader is popular on Facebook and  to what extent?  
BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra  Modi and AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal had verified ‘Fan pages’  in their respective names on Facebook. But Congress’s  Rahul Gandhi did not have one. Hence, for the study,  the Facebook fan pages of ‘Narendra Modi’, ‘Arvind  Kejriwal’ and ‘Indian National Congress’ were

considered and the varying number of ‘Likes’ on each of  those pages were recorded on a daily-basis for analysis.  Each of these fan pages will represent one of the  chosen parties—the Congress, BJP and Aam Aadmi  Party. 
To estimate the political trend on Facebook— that is, how popular the party and politicians chosen for  
the study are on Facebook—a one-way Anova test was  conducted which would identify statistically significant  differences among them with regard to the number of  new ‘likes’ recorded on their respective Facebook fan  pages during the period of study. 
The results are presented in Table 5.

India Elections 2014: Time-Lagged Correlation between Media Bias and Facebook Trend 
A Spearman’s rank-order correlation was run to  determine the relationship between the political trends  on Facebook and election results. There was a strong,  positive correlation between them, which was  statistically significant (rs = 1.000, p < .01).  
There is a strong correlation between the  average number of new likes recorded during the study  period and the election results.  
Hence, the hypothesis that more number of new  ‘likes’ recorded on the fan page of a party or the  representative of the party means more votes for that  party in the election is tenable. 
RQ5. Is the press trend associated with the Facebook  popularity? 
Based on the polarity and position of political  items published in the newspapers, daily scores were  
assigned to the parties under six categories—Congress  positive, Congress negative, BJP positive, BJP negative,  AAP positive and AAP negative. These daily scores for  the parties in the four newspapers combined were used  to understand the underlying political trends in the  newspapers. Similarly, the Facebook fan pages of  ‘Narendra Modi’, ‘Arvind Kejriwal’ and ‘Indian National  Congress’ were considered and the varying number of  ‘Likes’ on each of those pages were recorded on a  daily-basis for analysis. To measure the effect of press  trends on Facebook, the daily positivity scores for the  three parties chosen in the newspapers and the number  of new ‘likes’ recorded on each day of the study period

Figure 2 : Time-series plot for daily increase in the number of Fan page ‘likes’ 
Analysing Fig.1 and 2, it is observed that the curves exhibit seasonal fluctuations hiding the  underlying trend. It is also observed that the curves  sport a trend and not stationary. A series is stationary if  
its mean and variance stay about the same over the  length of the series. 
To estimate the immediate effect of the print  media on Facebook using cross-correlation, the time-

series need to be stationary. Hence, using the first order  of difference of the time-series, the original curves are  converted into stationary curves. Then the time-series for  
Congress party in the newspapers and Facebook were  cross-correlated and the results are presented in  Table10.

India Elections 2014: Time-Lagged Correlation between Media Bias and Facebook Trend 
Though the time-lagged correlation coefficients  found an association between the press and Facebook  trends at several lags, those are about seasonal  fluctuations. The study aims at establishing a correlation  between the long term political trends of Facebook and  the print media. Since the original curves are highly  distorted by seasonal fluctuations, the curves are  
decomposed to extract the seasonal component by  calculating the moving averages for seven periods— since data were collected on all the seven days of a  week. After the seasonal component is removed from  the original curves, the residual data is subjected to  correlation analysis and the results of the analysis are  presented in Table 11.

both the political trends in the print media and on

2014 Lok Sabha elections. Press trend or media bias  G
(Congress – 35.88%; BJP – 49.12% and AAP – 15.01%)  was highly in favour of the BJP party and correlated with  the popular vote share of the parties in the polls that the  BJP won. Similarly, the political trend on Facebook  (Congress – 25.67%; BJP – 58.6% and AAP – 15.73%)  that was tracked using the number of ‘likes’ recorded on  the fan pages of the parties and their popular  candidates was highly in favour of the BJP and  
© 2015 Global Journals Inc. (US) 
correlated with the election results (Congress – 36.89%;  BJP – 59.21% and AAP – 3.91%). That is, analysing the  bias in the press reports published during the election,  the probable winner of the elections can be predicted. In  simple terms, more positive news and comparatively  lesser amount of negative news published in the  newspapers means more votes for the party in the  elections. Similarly, the number of ‘likes’ recorded on the  Facebook fan page of a party or its candidate can be  used to estimate how popular the party or candidate is  among the people. The study results have shown that  the political trend on Facebook can also be used to  predict the probable winner. 
The thread that connects the print media and  Facebook are the people. People who read news  reports published in the papers are influenced by it and  when they lend their support to their favourite parties on  Facebook, that influence is felt. This theory was found to  be tenable through statistical tests. A correlation was  found to exist between press and Facebook trends. That  is, the effect of political news published in the papers  during the election period was felt on Facebook with  variations in the number of ‘likes’ recorded on the fan  pages of the parties. 
The present study investigated both short- and  long-term effects. Cross-correlation analyses were  performed to estimate the immediate effects. It was  found that in all three cases—the Congress, BJP and  AAP—the press trend was a leading indicator. That is,  the press trend can be used as a predictor for the  Facebook trend. In other words, analysing the number  of positive and negative reports published in the  newspapers, the probable increase or decrease in the  number of ‘likes’ recorded on the Facebook fan pages  
India Elections 2014: Time-Lagged Correlation between Media Bias and Facebook Trend 
can be predicted. However, the strongest amount of  correlation between press and Facebook trends was  found to be several lags away. That is, the effect of  media reports on Facebook was not immediately felt,  but several periods—in the present case, several  days—later. The study was more interested in finding a  correlation between the long-term political trends of the  newspapers and Facebook. 
Positive correlations were reported indicating  that the newspapers had an effect on Facebook—which  in turn, shows that the newspapers had an effect on the  people. 
Since media bias, Facebook trend and the  electionresults correlated, the present study concludes  that just by studying the content of a mass media that  people avidly use, the outcome of the election—or any  other future behaviour of the people—can be predicted.
