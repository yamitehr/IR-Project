This study explored Facebook users’ hostile perceptions of shared news content and its relationship with their political  participation. This study conducted an online experiment with a 3 (news slant: pro-attitudinal, neutral, counter-attitudinal)⋅3  (news sharer: in-group, neutral, out-group) between-subjects design. This experiment was administered in the context of the  abortion issue in South Korea. Consistent with the hostile media effect, the news slant (pro-attitudinal, counter-attitudinal)  of shared news content was found to influence Facebook users’ hostile perceptions of shared news content. Out-group  sharers also significantly affected their hostile perceptions of shared news content. However, in-group sharers did not.  Furthermore, the effect of Facebook users’ hostile perceptions of shared news content on their willingness for political  participation was moderated by their prior minority perception in the general society. Only for Facebook users with high  levels of prior minority perception in the general society, their hostile perceptions of shared news content appeared to  encourage their political engagement. The implications of these findings were discussed.

Social media has played an important role in delivering news  content. Facebook is one of the most popular social media  platforms for news content (Shearer & Klein, 2019).  Facebook users are exposed to a constant flow of news con 
tent or information shared by others from their online net works (Mitchell et al., 2016). They can encounter agreeable  or disagreeable content shared by their online friends with  diverse political or social backgrounds (Duggan & Smith,  2016). Abundant studies have examined individuals’ bias  perceptions of news content using the hostile media effect  (HME), which posits that individuals who are highly  involved in a contentious issue evaluate neutral news content  on that issue as biased against their positions (Gunther &  Liebhart, 2006; Vallone et al., 1985). The HME was origi 
nally documented by using traditional media content such as  newspaper articles or television news programs. However,  recently, some studies have started to examine the HME in  online media settings and found that online news content  (e.g., blog posting, Twitter content) can produce the HME  (e.g., M. Kim, 2015; E. J. Lee, 2012; T. K. Lee et al., 2018;  Yun et al., 2016). Furthermore, the scope of HME research  has been extended to include the role of online news sharers.  Specifically, T. K. Lee et al. (2018) demonstrated that parti san news sharers (Republicans or Democrats) influence  
Twitter users’ bias perception of shared news content.  Drawing on the prior research on the HME of social media  content, this study jointly investigates the role of news slant  and news sharers in Facebook users’ hostile perceptions of  news content shared by others. 
Furthermore, this study examines how Facebook users’  hostile perceptions of shared news content influence their  intended political participation. Facebook users’ political  expression has been investigated from the theoretical frame 
work of the corrective action hypothesis (Rojas, 2010) and  the spiral of silence (Noelle-Neumann, 1974, 1993). The spi ral of silence theory indicates that Facebook users’ minority  perceptions discourage their willingness to speak out (Chen,  2018; Gearhart & Zhang, 2015; M. Kim, 2016a), whereas the  corrective action hypothesis maintains that their hostile per ceptions of shared news content lead to politically expressive  activities (Barnidge & Rojas, 2014; Hwang et al., 2008).  Motivated to reconcile the spiral of silence theory and the

corrective action hypothesis, this study investigates a possi ble moderating role of Facebook users’ prior minority per ceptions in the relationship between their hostile perceptions  of shared news content and their willingness for political  participation. 
The Slant of News Content on  
Facebook 
Numerous HME studies have demonstrated that individuals  with opposing views evaluate the same news content differ ently depending on whether the slant of news content is con sistent or inconsistent with their own opinion (Perloff, 2015).  Those who are highly involved with a controversial issue  want to maintain their own attitude toward that issue even  when they encounter counter-attitudinal news content  (Gunther, 1992). For holding on to their original position,  they tend to engage in the biased processing of news content  (Petty & Cacioppo, 1979). 
As a consequence, people tend to evaluate pro-attitudinal  content to be favorable or less biased, which produces assim ilation effects (Gunther et al., 2009). Conversely, people turn  to perceive counter-attitudinal content to be unfavorable or  more biased, which generates contrast effects, the HME  (Choi et al., 2009; Gunther et al., 2009). Accordingly, those  who have an incongruent view with a news slant are more  likely to perceive the news as more biased than those who  hold a congruent view with the news slant (Coe et al., 2008;  Feldman, 2011; Gunther & Chia, 2001; M. Kim, 2016b). 
The HME has been empirically tested in the context of tra ditional media. However, recently, some researchers have  turned their attention to investigating the HME in social media  environments (e.g., M. Kim, 2015; T. K. Lee et al., 2018; Yun  et al., 2016). For instance, M. Kim (2015) showed that indi viduals who disagreed with a blog content evaluated the blog  content as more hostile and less trustworthy than did those  who agreed with the blog content. This shows that depending  on the news slant (agreeable or disagreeable), social media  content can generate assimilation or contrast effects. 
Summarizing existing literature, Facebook users’ bias per ceptions of shared news content can “fall anywhere on a con tinuum from assimilation to contrast” (Gunther et al., 2009, p.  748). Thus, Facebook users may evaluate attitude-consistent  content to be relatively more favorable, whereas they may  judge attitude-discrepant content to be relatively more unfa vorable. This leads to proposing the following hypothesis: 
H1. Facebook users will perceive pro-attitudinal content  to be relatively more favorable, while they will perceive  counter-attitudinal content to be relatively more hostile. 
News Sharer as a News Source 
With the prevalence of partisan news sources, HME scholars  have begun to consider the role of news sources in individuals’  
bias perceptions of news content. The self-categorization  (Turner et al., 1987) and social identity theory (Tajfel &  Turner, 1979) have provided a theoretical framework for  exploring source effects on the HME. From the perspective of  self-categorization (Turner et al., 1987), when an in-group  identity is salient, individuals seek to understand themselves  as in-group members. They thus become focused on not only  the traits that they share with in-group members but also the  characteristics that distinguish them from out-group members.  To achieve their positive self-concept, they positively assess  the traits of the in-group members and negatively evaluate  those of the out-group members (Hornsey, 2008; Tajfel &  Turner, 1979). Accordingly, people tend to evaluate more pos itively news content from in-group members compared to the  same news from out-group members. Indeed, many HME  studies have demonstrated such source effects on the HME  (Ariyanto et al., 2007; Arpan & Raney, 2003; Gunther et al.,  2017; M. Kim, 2016b, 2019; Reid, 2012). For instance, Yun  et al. (2016) indicated that individuals’ exposure to blog news  content from an inconsistent media source increases their hos tile perception of the news content, whereas their exposure to  blog news content from a consistent media source decreases it. 
Previous studies mentioned above have focused on tradi tional news media as a news source. As news sharing activi ties play a pivotal role in distributing news content on social  media platforms (Gottfried & Shearer, 2016), some studies  have attempted to extend the scope of news sources to news  sharers. For example, T. K. Lee et al. (2018) demonstrated  that both partisan groups (Democrats and Republicans) eval uated news content shared by a Twitter user from a rival  political party to be more unfavored against their position  than the same news content shared by a Twitter user from  their own political party. Partisans appeared to self-catego rize a news sharer as an in-group or out-group source depend ing on whether their own political orientation is consistent  with the news sharer’s party affiliation. Guided by this litera ture, this study predicts that Facebook users will assimilate  news content shared by an in-group member, whereas they  will contrast news content shared by an out-group member.  Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed: 
H2. Facebook users will perceive news content shared by  an in-group member to be relatively more favorable,  while they will perceive news content shared by an out group member to be relatively more hostile. 
Facebook Users’ Corrective Actions  and Prior Minority Perception 
The corrective action hypothesis and the spiral of silence the ory have commonly addressed individuals’ willingness to  speak out. However, both theoretical models focus on differ ent causal factors of people’s political expression or participa tion. The corrective action hypothesis considers individuals’  perceived bias as a predictor of their participation in corrective 
Kim 3 
actions. This hypothesis postulates that when people encoun ter others’ opinions or news content opposing their view, they  speak up their voices or take actions in public to “correct” per ceived biases or wrongs (Rojas, 2010). The spiral of silence  theory centers on people’s perceived minority status for  explaining their expressive activities. This theory posits that  those who perceive themselves as a minority are reluctant to  make their voice heard in public because they fear social isola tion (Noelle-Neumann, 1974, 1993). According to the theory,  when individuals believe that a majority opinion is different  from their own views, they remain silent. 
This study attempts to jointly examine the corrective  action hypothesis and the spiral of silence theory by measur ing each predictor of both theories in the context of news use  on Facebook. 
Facebook Users’ Corrective Actions 
According to the corrective action hypothesis (Rojas, 2010),  individuals with hostile perceptions of news content believe the  persuasive impacts of the news content on others, which leads  to their corrective actions. Many studies have provided empiri 
cal evidence for supporting the corrective action hypothesis  (Barnidge & Rojas, 2014; Tsfati & Cohen, 2005). For instance,  Hwang et al. (2008) demonstrated people’s perceptions of par tisan bias in traditional media had a positive impact on their  intention to engage in discursive activities through intensifying  media indignation. In addition to political conversations, the  hostile perceptions of news coverage can encourage people’s  particular actions. Specifically, Choi et al. (2011) showed that  the HME induces advocacy groups to adopt more aggressive  advocacy strategies including attacking counterparts. 
The HME is also found to be positively related to expres sive activities online. Rojas (2010) showed that people’s hos tile perception of mass media was positively associated with  their online political behaviors such as emailing political  views and posting comments in online discussion forums. In  the same vein, McKeever et al. (2017) demonstrated that  when individuals perceive the news coverage of a particular  issue to be biased or hostile, they are more likely to express  their views about the issue online. Some studies also indi cated that as a corrective action, people tend to comment on  online news stories that they judged to be biased against their  opinion (Chung et al., 2015; Yun et al., 2016). Based on prior  research on the corrective action hypothesis, the following  hypothesis is proposed: 
H3. Facebook users’ hostile perception of news content  will be positively related to their willingness for political  participation. 
Facebook Users’ Prior Minority Perception 
The spiral of silence theory (Noelle-Neumann, 1974) that  was documented in the age of mass media has been largely  
applied to specific online environments such as social media  platforms or online forums. Many studies have shown that  people’s minority perceptions on particular online settings in  which they were directed to speak out suppress their expres 
sion (Chen, 2018; Gearhart & Zhang, 2015; M. Kim, 2016a;  Leong & Ho, 2020; Yun & Park, 2011). 
Social media users may often infer their opinion’s relative  standing (majority or minority) from their opinion’s histori cal status and legitimacy in the general society (Hoffner &  Rhenkoff, 2011). As Yun et al. (2016) put it, there may be a  difference between a social media user’s perceived opinion  climate on one’s social media network and in the general  society. Indeed, Yun et al. (2016) found people’s minority  perception online was influenced by the perceived slant of  manipulated online news through their perceived influence  of that news. Conversely, their minority perception in the  general society was not significantly related to the perceived  slant of manipulated online news and the perceived influence  of that news. This suggests that Facebook users may estimate  the general society’s opinion climate from various sources  beyond Facebook content. Therefore, when people are  exposed to news content on social media, their prior minority  perceptions may play a distinct role in their willingness for  political expression. Based on this discussion, this study  examines the spiral of silence phenomenon among Facebook  users by measuring their prior minority perception in the  general society. The following hypothesis is posited: 
H4. Facebook users’ prior minority perception will be  negatively associated with their willingness for political  participation. 
As mentioned earlier, the corrective action hypothesis and  the spiral of silence theory have employed distinct predictors  of people’s expression or participation. This suggests that  two theories may operate together as one theory modifies a  predictor of the other. Therefore, this study attempts to  explore how the corrective action hypothesis and the spiral  of silence theory work together among Facebook users.  Specifically, this study investigates whether and how  Facebook users’ prior minority perceptions interact with  their hostile perceptions of news content in influencing their  willingness for political participation. Thus, a related  research question is pursued: 
RQ1. Do Facebook users’ prior minority perceptions  interact with their hostile perceptions of news content to  influence their willingness for political participation? 
Method 
To examine proposed hypotheses and research question, this  study employed a web-based experiment with a 3 (news slant:  pro-attitudinal, neutral, counter-attitudinal)⋅3 (news sharer:  in-group, neutral, out-group) between-subjects design. This 
4 Social Media + Society 
experiment was conducted in the context of the abortion issue  in South Korea in July 2018. South Korea enacted the anti abortion law in 1953 (Ock, 2019). South Korea’s Constitutional  Court was scheduled to judge whether the anti-abortion law  was constitutional or not in the spring 2019. Before the deci sion of the Court, the controversy over the abortion issue was  mounting in South Korea in July 2018. 
Participants 
Participants were recruited via a leading research company  in South Korea. The company maintains a nationally repre sentative panel. The panel consists of people who have vol untarily expressed their willingness to participate in the  survey. Initially, a total of 2,445 individuals were randomly  selected from the panel. The online invitation was sent out to  all of them. For selecting actual Facebook users, those who  reported that they did not use Facebook at all in the last week  were excluded. Partisanship or prior opinion (pro or con) on  a controversial issue has been considered to be an antecedent  of the HME (Choi et al., 2009; Gunther et al., 2009).  Therefore, participants who indicated a neutral position on  the abortion issue were excluded. Those who did not com pletely finish the survey were also excluded. 
This process resulted in a total sample of 512 participants  (259 men, 253 women; age: M=34.47, SD=8.21). Overall,  participants were well educated. The majority of the partici pants reported having a BA degree (70.5%), followed by a  high-school diploma (18%) and a graduate degree (11.5%).  In terms of monthly household income, 32.8% of the respon dents indicated between US$3,600 and US$5,400, followed  by between US$1,700 and US$3,600 (29.9%), between  US$5,400 and US$7,100 (18.2%), above US$7,100 (9.6%),  and under US$1,700 (9.6%). The average monthly house hold income of the participants was between US$3,600 and  US$5,400. Given that the average monthly household  income of the Korean population in 2018 was US$4,200  (Shin, 2021), about half of the participants appeared to have  the average or above-average income in South Korea. 
Procedure 
Participants received an email containing instructions and a  link to a study website. First of all, they were directed to  access a pretest questionnaire that asked about their positions  on the abortion issue and their prior minority perceptions.  Upon completing the pretest survey, participants were ran 
domly assigned to one of the nine Facebook page conditions.  They were asked to view a mockup of the Facebook page  showing a news posting shared by one of the three users (in group, neural, or out-group). All participants were directed to  click the headline of the shared news posting and read a  linked new content (pro-attitudinal, neutral, or counter-atti tudinal). Once the participants finished reading the news  content, they were asked to complete a post-survey  
measuring their hostile perceptions of the news story they  had read and their intention of political participation. 
Stimulus Materials 
Three types of Facebook pages were created to follow the  design and outline of the actual Facebook page. Facebook  pages show a news posting shared by one of the three news  sharers (pro-life, neutral, or pro-choice). Participants in a  neutral news sharer version were exposed to a news posting  shared by a Facebook user with the following comments, “I  am sharing below news story. Please read this story.” People  in a pro-life news sharer version were exposed to a news  posting shared by a Facebook user with the following com ments, “I am a director of the Citizen Network for Pro-life. I  am sharing below news story. Please read this story.” The  participants were told that, “The Citizen Network for Pro-life  describes itself as a network for 15 grassroots organizations  devoted to opposing the abolition of the anti-abortion law.”  Participants in a pro-choice news sharer condition were  exposed to a news posting shared by a Facebook user with  the following comments, “I am a director of the Citizen  Network for Pro-choice. I am sharing below news story.  Please read this story.” The participants were told that, “the  Citizen Network for Pro-choice describes itself as a network  for 15 nonprofit organizations devoted to abolishing the anti abortion law.” 
In addition to news sharers, three versions of news stories  (pro-life, neutral, pro-choice) were created based on actual  news stories about the abortion issue. The news stories’ slant  was tested by a group of 10 graduate students. They unani 
mously evaluated the slant of news content as intended. All  news stories were attributed to the Seoul Daily Newspaper widely known as a politically neutral newspaper in South  Korea (Choi et al., 2012). The news article pages were cre ated to resemble the layout of the online version of the Seoul  Daily Newspaper with its logo and a headline reading,  “Heating up the controversy on the abortion ban.” 
Pretest Measures 
The participants’ prior opinion on the abortion issue was  measured by asking, “To what extent do you support or  oppose the abolition of the anti-abortion law?” (−5=strongly  support, 5=strongly oppose). The difference in opinions  between supporters (N=254, M=−3.35, SD=1.45) and  opponents (N=258, M=2.81, SD=1.45) of the focal issue  was significant, t (510)=−47.97, p<.001. 
In addition, based on the prior research (e.g., Wojcieszak,  2017), this study measured participants’ pre-existing minor ity perceptions. Participants were asked to indicate how  many Koreans shared their opinions on the issue of abortion  (1=very few, 7=majority) (M=4.47, SD=0.99). All  responses were reversed. Therefore, higher scores indicate  higher levels of minority perceptions.

Posttest Measures 
In line with previous studies (e.g., Gunther et al., 2017; T. K.  Lee et al., 2018), the participants’ hostile perception was  measured by asking the following: “Would you say that the  news article is biased for or against the abolition of the anti 
abortion law?” and “Would you say that the journalist  responsible for this news article is biased for or against the  abolition of the anti-abortion law?” (−5=strongly biased in  favor, 5=strongly biased against). Responses to all items  were averaged (α=.93). The answers were recoded based on  the participants’ positions. The original responses from the  supporters of the abolition of the anti-abortion law were  retained. The responses of the opponents were reverse coded. Positive scores show perceptions of hostile slant,  whereas negative scores show perceptions of favorable slant  (M=−0.09, SD=1.99). 
To measure the willingness for political participation, par ticipants were asked to report the possibility of engaging in  seven offline political activities surrounding the abortion  issue within the next 6months (1=very unlikely, 7=very  likely). These activities include “participating in a protest,  demonstration or march,” “joining a political or civic organi zation,” and “attending a public hearing or town hall meet ing.” Answers to all items were averaged (α=.98, M=2.96,  SD=1.70). 
Control Variables 
Facebook network size and Facebook use were controlled in  all the analyses. For Facebook network size, participants  were directed to indicate the number of Facebook friends  (M=143, SD=206). Facebook use was measured by asking  “on a typical day, how often do you use Facebook?” (1 = not  at all, 2 = once a day, 3 = every 5hr, 4 = every 4hr, 5 = every  3hr, 6 = every 2hr, 7 = every hour, 8 = every 30min, 9 = every 10min, 10 = every 2min) (M=3.52, SD=2.04). In  addition, demographic variables such as age, gender, educa 
tion, and monthly household income were measured and  entered as control variables in all analyses. 
Results 
Manipulation Checks 
First of all, to check that the news slant was perceived as  intended, participants were asked to report how much they  thought the news article support or oppose the abolition of  the anti-abortion law (−5=strongly support, +5=strongly  oppose). One-sample t test was conducted with a group of  those who were exposed to a news article manipulated to be  neutral (M=−0.01, SD=2.12). Results showed that the per 
ceived slant of the news article was not significantly differ ent from the scale midpoint (0.00), t (178)=−0.03, p=.97,  attesting to the neutrality of the news article. In addition, an  
independent t test was conducted with participants who were  assigned to a news article supporting or opposing the aboli tion of the anti-abortion law. The news article manipulated in  favor of the abolition of the anti-abortion law was considered  to support the abolition (M=−1.68, SD=2.80). In contrast,  the article that was created to be against abolition was per ceived to oppose it (M=1.91, SD=2.86). The difference was  significant, t (331)=11.58, p<.001. This check confirmed  
that participants perceived the news slant as intended. Next, to assure that news sharers’ issue positions were  recognized, participants were directed to indicate how much  they thought the news sharers support or oppose the abolition  of the anti-abortion law (−5=strongly support, +5=strongly  oppose). Results of one-sample t test showed that a news  sharer manipulated to be neutral was perceived as intended  (M=0.06, SD=1.86). The perceived opinion of the news  sharer was not significantly different from the scale midpoint  (0.00), t (178)=0.44, p=.66. A news sharer manipulated to  support or oppose the abolition of the anti-abortion was also  perceived as intended. A news sharer, a director of the Citizen  Network for Pro-choice, was regarded to be in favor of the  abolition of the anti-abortion law (M=−0.1.82, SD=2.59),  while a news sharer, a director of the Citizen Network for  Pro-life, was considered to be against the abolition (M=1.95,  SD=2.65). The difference was significant, t (331)=13.17,  p<.001. 
Hypothesis Tests 
For testing Hypotheses 1 and 2, a two-way analysis of cova riance (ANCOVA) was performed controlling for demo graphics (i.e., age, gender, education, and income), Facebook  network size, and Facebook use (see Table 1). Hypothesis 1  predicted that Facebook users will perceive pro-attitudinal  content to be relatively more favorable, while they will per ceive counter-attitudinal content to be relatively more hos tile. Results of the ANCOVA showed a significant main  effect of news slant, F(2, 497)=56.79, p<.001, ηp2 =.19.  Pairwise comparisons by using the Sidak demonstrated that  pro-attitudinal news content (M=−1.08, SD=0.14) was per ceived as more favorable than the balanced news content  (M=−0.15, SD=0.13), p<.001. In addition, counter-attitudi nal news content (M=0.99, SD=0.14) was estimated to be  more hostile than the balanced news content, p<.001.  Therefore, Hypothesis 1 was supported. 
Hypothesis 2 predicted that Facebook users will perceive  news content shared by an in-group member to be relatively  more favorable, while they will perceive news content shared  by an out-group member to be relatively more hostile. A sig 
nificant main effect of news sharers was found, F(2,  497)=11.63, p<.001, ηp2 =.05. Results of the pairwise com parisons indicated that there was no significant difference  between an in-group sharer (M=−0.48, SD=0.14) and a neu tral news sharer (M=−0.20, SD=0.13) in bias perceptions of  news content, p=.38. However, the news content shared by

Hypothesis 4 posited that Facebook users’ prior minority  perception is negatively related to their willingness for polit ical participation. Consistent with prediction, there was a  significant negative relationship between Facebook users’  minority perception and their willingness for political par ticipation (b=−.27, SE=.07, t=−3.75, p<.001). Therefore,  Hypothesis 4 was supported. 
Research Question 1 asked whether Facebook users’  minority perception moderates the relationship between their  hostile perceptions of news content and political participa tion.

an out-group Facebook user (M=0.44, SD=0.14) was judged  as significantly hostile than the news content shared by a  neutral user, p<.01. Therefore, Hypothesis 2 was partially  supported. 
For testing Hypotheses 3 and 4, and Research Question 1,  a moderation test was conducted using the SPSS PROCESS  macro (Model 1) (Hayes, 2013) (see Table 2). Hypothesis 3  predicted that Facebook users’ perception of hostile slant is  positively related to their willingness for political participa 
tion. Results showed that there was no significant relation ship between Facebook users’ perceptions of news content  and their intention of political engagement (b=.04, SE=.04,  t=1.18, p=.24). Thus, Hypothesis 3 was not supported. 
tions of news content on Facebook and the intention of polit ical participation was significant only among those with high  levels of minority perceptions. This association was not sig nificant among those who have average and low levels of  minority perceptions. These findings indicate that the effect  of Facebook users’ hostile perceptions of news content on  their political engagement is conditional on their prior minor ity perceptions. 
Discussion 
This study explored Facebook users’ hostile perceptions of  shared news content and its relationship with their political  participation. Consistent with the HME, the news slant (pro attitudinal, counter-attitudinal) was found to influence  Facebook users’ hostile perceptions of shared news content.  Out-group sharers also significantly affected their hostile  perceptions of shared news content. However, in-group shar ers did not. Furthermore, the effect of Facebook users’ hos tile perceptions of shared news content on their willingness  for political participation was moderated by their prior  minority perception in the general society. Only for Facebook

users with high levels of prior minority perception in the  general society, the hostile perception of shared news content  was found to encourage their political engagement. 
The findings from this study provide several theoretical  and political implications. First of all, this study extends the  prior research on the HME by jointly examining the role of  news slant and news sharers in the Facebook context. As  expected, this study found that the pro-attitudinal content on  Facebook was perceived to be relatively more favorable,  whereas the counter-attitudinal content was perceived to be  relatively more hostile. Consistent with the literature on the  HME (e.g., Gunther et al., 2017), the pro-attitudinal content  on Facebook appeared to produce assimilation effects and  the counter-attitudinal content on Facebook seemed to create  contrast effects. 
News sharers were also found to play a role in Facebook  users’ bias perception of news content. However, the find ings of this study suggest that news sharers influence  Facebook users’ assessment of news content in a more  nuanced way. Consistent with the prior research on source  effects on the HME (e.g., T. K. Lee et al., 2018), news con tent shared by an out-group user was perceived to be more  hostile than the same news content shared by a neutral user.  As the self-categorization theory posits (Turner et al., 1987),  Facebook users seemed to categorize a news sharer who  holds an opinion incongruent with their own as an out-group  news source. They might consider an out-group news sharer  as a threat to their group. Therefore, they seemed to defen sively process news content shared by an out-group user and,  as a consequence, perceived it to be more hostile than the  same news content shared by a neutral user. 
Of interest, an in-group sharer did not influence Facebook  users’ hostile perceptions of news content. There was no dif ference between Facebook users’ hostile perceptions of news  content shared by a neutral user and an in-group user. When  Facebook users were exposed to news content shared by an  in-group member, they might not perceive any group threat,  and thus, their group identity might not be salient. As a result,  Facebook users seemed to evaluate news content shared by  an in-group user only depending on whether the slant of  news content was consistent with their own position. 
Previous studies have demonstrated that in-group media  sources contribute to mitigating individuals’ hostile percep tions of news stories (Ariyanto et al., 2007; Arpan & Raney,  2003; Gunther et al., 2017; M. Kim, 2016b, 2019; Reid,  2012). Particularly, M. Kim (2016b) suggests that in-group  media sources may give a chance for people to carefully  consider disagreeable news content by decreasing the level  of their hostile perceptions of the disagreeable news.  Contrary to in-group media sources, in-group news sharers  were not found to have such buffering effects on Facebook  users’ hostile perceptions of disagreeable news content.  Instead, this study shows that the out-group news sharing  provides a boost for the HME of disagreeable content on  the Facebook space. Facebook users can be intentionally or  unintentionally exposed to cross-cutting news shared by  their online friends (Y. Kim, 2011; Min & Wohn, 2018).  Some scholars have argued that those who are exposed to  cross-cutting news may have opportunities for recognizing  the other side’s opinion and rethink their own position,  which may lead to ambivalent attitudes (Meffert et al.,  2004). However, the findings of this study suggest that  Facebook users’ frequent exposure to the cross-cutting  news shared by out-group or in-group members may not  weaken but strengthen their own opinion by increasing  their hostility toward the other side. This may further bol ster the opinion polarization regarding controversial issues  among Facebook users. 
The most noteworthy finding of this study is that the spi ral of silence and the corrective action hypothesis can oper ate together among Facebook users. This study contributes to  extending the literature on both theories by illustrating the  conditions under which the theories work to expect social  media users’ political participation. Specifically, consistent  with the spiral of silence, this study found Facebook users’  pre-existing minority perceptions in the general society were  negatively associated with their willingness for political par ticipation. These findings show that regardless of news slant  they are encountering on Facebook, those with prior majority  perceptions are more likely to participate in offline political  actions compared to those with prior minority perceptions. 
Contrary to the expectation from the corrective action  hypothesis, Facebook users’ hostile perception of news con tent was not associated with their willingness for political  participation. However, this relationship was moderated by  Facebook users’ pre-existing minority perceptions. The posi tive association between Facebook users’ hostile perception  of news content and their intended participation was mani fest only for those with high levels of prior minority percep tions. That is, the corrective action hypothesis appeared to  function only for Facebook users with high levels of prior  minority perceptions. This shows that even though Facebook  users with prior minority perceptions are less participatory  than those with prior majority perceptions, their offline polit ical engagement can be encouraged by the exposure to politi cal differences on Facebook. It is probably because minority  
8 Social Media + Society 
opinion holders may inherently want to change their status  quo in opinion climates and persuade or influence others to  support their “unpopular” views or beliefs (Moscovici, 1980;  Wojcieszak, 2017). This latent desire may be activated when  they perceive shared news content to be hostile rather than  favorable. Minority opinion holders’ opinion strength may  be another plausible explanation for their willingness for  corrective actions. Those who have strong partisanship or  opinions are more likely to engage in corrective actions in a  hostile opinion climate (Duncan et al., 2020; M. Kim, 2016a).  Minority opinion holders who showed high levels of willing ness for corrective actions might have unpopular but strong  views. 
Naturally, this study had several limitations. First, partici pants of this experimental study were exposed to manipu lated news content shared by a fabricated and unknown  Facebook user. This might be somewhat different from news  content and news sharers the participants encounter in their  real Facebook pages, which might affect the ecological  validity of this study. Also, shared news content was created  to appear to be online news from a news organization, the  Seoul Daily Newspaper. Even though this newspaper is  known as a politically neutral newspaper (Choi et al., 2012),  individuals’ bias perceptions of this newspaper can be sub jective. Participants’ subjective evaluations of this newspa per might influence their perceptions of news content  provided by that newspaper. Thus, the results of this study  should be interpreted with the limitations of manipulations in  mind. Second, this study measured Facebook users’ self reported minority perceptions. People’s perceptions of opin ion climate in a society may be different from the real opinion  distribution. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to differenti ate the real and perceived minority in future research. 
Third, this study mainly examined Facebook users’ will ingness for offline political participation. Given that online  has emerged as an important venue for political expression,  future studies could investigate the relationships between  Facebook users’ hostile perceptions, minority perceptions,  and online political engagement. Finally, this study was con ducted using one controversial issue, abortion. The knowl edge on the abortion issue might influence people’s hostile  perceptions and opinion expression regarding that issue.  Thus, future researchers should consider measuring and con trolling participants’ levels of issue knowledge to offer a  more complete understanding of Facebook users’ political  engagement. Furthermore, the abortion issue is categorized  as an easy issue related to one’s religious and moral values  (Johnston & Wronski, 2013). It is needed to validate the  results of this study by using hard issues such as economic  issues. 
Despite the above limitations, this study sheds light on  nuanced relationships between Facebook news sharing, hos tile perceptions of news content, and political participation.  More importantly, the findings of this study contribute to the  field of the corrective action hypothesis and the spiral of  
silence theory by showing how both theories operate together  among Facebook users.
