Social Comparison, Envy, and Depression  on Facebook: A Study Looking at the Effects of High Comparison Standards on Depressed Individuals 
Helmut Appel, Jan Crusius, and Alexander L. Gerlach University of Cologne 
The co-occurrence of depression and envy is both plausible and empirically es tablished. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying this corre lation. An account is proposed according to which low self-esteem in depressed  individuals leads to upward social comparison and thus makes envy more like ly. This effect should frequently occur in online social networks like Facebook  because they allow for easy impression management and hence provide high  comparison standards. In a quasi-experimental online study, depressed and non depressed participants indicated their self-esteem and were then presented with  specifically set up Facebook profiles that were either attractive or unattractive.  Participants were asked to compare themselves to the profile owner and to report  their resulting feelings of inferiority and envy. Depressed participants were more  envious, especially after seeing the attractive profile. Envy was associated with  higher self-reported inferiority and also correlated negatively with self-esteem.  The connection between depression and envy is demonstrated with an experi mental elicitation of envy for the first time. The results strongly suggest that low  self-esteem and consequent feelings of inferiority play a crucial role in depressed  individuals’ elevated levels of envy. Practical implications and limitations are dis cussed.
