Abstract 
Currently, lots of enterprises widely use social network site for marketing campaigns, however, there are still limited litera ture in the related fields. This study investigated the deter minant factors for the successful implementation of Facebook  
marketing by enterprises. Using the marketing communication  model developed by Hoffman & Novak [20] as well as source  credibility, social ties, consumer value and the involvement  theory, this study tested the impact transferring messages 
through media on the message receiver’s decision-making  behavior. A total of 256 smart phone Facebookers were selected as research samples, and the hypotheses was tested using  regression analysis. The research findings suggested that  advertising messages provided by close friends only affect  consumer brand attitudes, but advertising messages provided  by commercial sources affect both consumer brand attitudes  and purchasing intentions. Utilitarian and recreational  advertising messages affect consumer advertising attitude,  brand attitudes, purchasing intentions and involvement. Lastly,  consumer involvement partially mediates the effects of utilitarian  advertising and recreational advertising on advertising attitude,  brand attitudes and purchasing intentions.

1. INTRODUCTION 
With the rising popularity of smart phones, the size and  importance of various social networking sites (SNS), such  as Facebook, Myspace, Plurk, Twitter and Youtube have be come increasingly important [57]. According to a recent survey, SNS’s have attracted more than 90% of adolescents  and young people with nearly 80 million members [46]. Of all the SNS’s, the most successful is Facebook [15]. At pre sent, Facebook has become the world’s largest SNS [17], with  more than 500 million members in July, 2010. Many enter prises are using Facebook to implement marketing activities  to promote product/service sales and enhance brand image  [46]. However, in practice, although discussions and success ful cases of Facebook marketing are common [47, 48], a proper understanding of the factors that affect the decision making behavior of Facebookers using smart phones is still  limited and inadequate[41].  
In order to understand the Facebook marketing communi cation model, this study referred to the marketing communica tion model in a computer-mediated environment (CME) proposed by Hoffman & Novak [20], and further extended their  
studies in three aspects. First, this study chose the message source and message content as the antecedent independent  variables, compared with the control, content and process as,  adopted by Hoffman & Novak [20]. A number of studies have  confirmed that specific message sources (such as close friends)  and message content (such as recreational messages and utilitarian messages) affect consumer behavior [13]; hence, this  study chose these two variables to discuss the impact of message  source and message content on consumer decision-making  behavior. Second, consumer heterogeneity may affect pur chasing intentions after coming in contact with the message  [20], for example, a Facebooker’s involvement may affect the  purchasing intentions after coming in contact with the product  message. This implies that the involvement may mediate the effects of the product message on the purchasing intentions.  However, Hoffman & Novak [20] did not further discuss the  mediating effects of involvement. To make up for the gap in the literature, this study tested whether Facebooker involve ment would mediate the effects of product messages on  advertising attitudes, brand attitudes and purchasing intentions.  Third, Hoffman & Novak [20] discussed consequence vari ables, including the goal-directed behavior (such as increased  learning) and experiential behavior (such as positive subjective  experience), without addressing the consumer decision-making  behavior. However, according to the viewpoints of social ties,  message sources with strong ties have a great impact on the  receiver [6, 53]. The consumer value viewpoint is that consumer  purchasing decisions and attitude are subject to the perception  of the value of the message [7]. To bridge the literature gap, this  study discussed the impact of Facebook message sources and  message content on consumer advertising attitude, brand attitudes  and purchasing intentions.  
In summary, the purposes of this study were: (1) to explore  the impact of message sources and message content on the  advertising attitude, brand attitudes and purchasing intentions  of Facebookers who use smart phones; and (2) to test whether  Facebooker involvement would mediate the effects of message  content on advertising attitude, brand attitudes and pur 
chasing intentions. This study first presented Facebook related marketing model concepts, hypotheses and reasoning.  The data collected included the descriptions of 300 smart mobile  phone users randomly browsing the message sources and mes sage content on Facebook, as well as a questionnaire that provided feedback on behavioral decision-making in special  circumstances. Next, this study conducted analysis relating to the theoretical models and hypotheses, explained the con clusions, and finally discussed the management applications of  the research findings.

2. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK  
AND HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT 
2.1 Conceptual framework 
This study used the marketing communication model in  the computer-mediated environment proposed by Hoffman & Novak [20] as the conceptual framework, and further extended  their studies in three perspectives so as to construct the ante cedent factors that will affect the decision-making behavior  of Facebooker, and the correlation among antecedent factors.  They studied World Wide Web in the CME and pointed out that consumers are able to carry out human-machine and  interpersonal interactions in a CME [20]. The interactivity with a computer allows the user to get involved and modify the content or form in the CME in real time [43]. In other words, consumers or enterprises (different message sources)  can create message content in the CME and get feedback and  interactions from other consumers, and can even affect the atti tude and behavior of other people [20].  
Zaichkowsky [53] pointed out that message content affects  consumer involvement. Hoffman & Novak [20] also pointed  out that the recreational and utilitarian benefits will affect  the involvement of the consumers. Wakefoeld & Barnes [49]  and Lloyd & Clancy [32] pointed out respectively that recrea 
tional messages create a sense of involvement and enhance the level of involvement. Furthermore, relevant studies had  pointed out that, the increasing consumer involvement would  further enhance brand attitudes and purchasing intentions [21, 25, 37]. Therefore, the consumer involvement might have  mediating effect [20], that is, it would mediate the effects of  product messages on advertising attitude, brand attitudes and  purchasing intentions. The conceptual model is shown as in Figure 1.  
2.1.1 Message source  
Keaveney & Parthasarathy [23] pointed out that message  sources can be divided into impersonal (such as commercial  source), interpersonal (such as close friends, acquaintances) or  experiential (such as the personal experience of using the product).  However, this study mainly discussed the decision-making  behavior of Facebookers after browsing messages provided  by different message sources. It was unclear how different  message sources (such as commercial sources, close friends, and  acquaintances) would affect Facebooker’s advertising attitude,  brand attitudes and purchasing intentions. Brown & Reingen [6]  pointed out that, compared with messages provided by weak ties  (such as commercial sources or acquaintances), strong ties (such  as close friends) have a greater impact on the receiver. Message  sources with strong ties will have higher credibility and will  enhance the intentions of the message receivers to accept product  recommendations [52] and further affect the attitudes [3] and  purchasing intentions [6].  
H1: Compared with acquaintances, when browsing  advertising messages from close friends, Facebookers’  advertising attitude, brand attitudes and purchasing  intentions will be enhanced. 
Nevertheless, the study had pointed out that, compared  with acquaintances, the receiver will be more likely to forward  advertising mail from commercial sources to close friends  [13]. This seemed to indicate the influence level of commercial  advertising on the receiver would be even higher than that from  acquaintances. In this regard, Porter & Whitcomb [39] explained  that, since the communicator can easily modify the website,  signature, and personalized greetings, the message receiver  would be affected accordingly. However, would advertising  
Spring 2012 Journal of Computer Information Systems 51 
messages from a commercial source have the same impact on  personal Facebook websites? Despite the lack of empirical  studies, Facebook marketing cases show that consumers with  brand preferences will actively join Facebook fan groups, browse  advertising messages, and get involved in marketing activities,  and the consumer’s brand attitudes and purchasing intentions  relatively improve [48].  
H2: Compared with acquaintances, when browsing  advertising messages from commercial sources,  Facebookers’ advertising attitude, brand attitudes and  purchasing intentions will be enhanced. 
2.1.2 Message content 
Message content refers to the message used to communicate  with consumers [2]. In this study, the message content under  discussion referred to the advertising messages provided by  enterprises, including recreational and utilitarian messages [8].  Recreational messages contain features such as amusement,  exploration, self-presentation and joy [1, 10]. They allow  consumers to perceive the participation in advertising activities  or the ability to play a certain role [49, 56]. The study had point  out that such perceptions of participation and advertising help  consumers more actively address relevant advertising messages  [50]. As recreational messages is persuasive to consumers [16],  consumers will generate relatively good advertising attitudes  when reading such advertising messages [29], and will be  encouraged to discuss brands and improve purchasing intentions  consequently [3].  
H3: When browsing recreational advertising messages,  Facebookers’ advertising attitude, brand attitudes and  purchasing intentions will be enhanced. 
Utilitarian messages contain tools or functional and cognitive  features, and are mainly used to provide consumers with value  [10]. For example, product storage, convenience, quality,  reliability and price can be categorized as utilitarian values [1,  10, 44]. When the message receiver perceives the value of the  messages provided by others, the purchasing intentions and  attitudes will be affected accordingly [6]. Relevant study had also  pointed out that utilitarian advertising messages will have impact  on advertising attitude [37], brand attitudes and purchasing  intentions of consumers [32].  
H4: When browsing utilitarian advertising messages,  Facebookers’ advertising attitude, brand attitudes and  purchasing intentions will be enhanced. 
2.1.3 Involvement  
Involvement refers to the perception of the correlation of  participation in advertising based on internal needs, values  and interests [53]. From the research in Zaichkowsky [53], the  antecedents of involvement include person factors (such as  personal value), stimulus factors (such as the communication  content) and situational factor (such as the participation of the  advertising activity). Some studies have also pointed out that  messages will have a greater impact on consumers with low  involvement [55], and that different message content will generate  different consumer involvement [53]. For example, recreational  
advertising messages improve consumer involvement [32].  Taking GAP for example, from December 15 to December 20,  2010, GAP clothing held a promotional activity on its Facebook  website, entitled, “Project Reindeer — The Deer Decides the  Deals!” (http://www.facebook.com/, date 2011/1/16). Eight  reindeer were selected to determine the daily promotional  content, with each reindeer representing a different promotional  discount (for example, 40% off the floor price, or buy one and get  one free). GAP included some type of competition each day, such  as deciding the discount level by having the reindeer compete in  races of walking speed or distance. The promotional activities  successfully attracted thousands of consumers to participate and  spend money at GAP.  
H5: When browsing recreational advertising messages,  Facebookers’ involvement will be enhanced. 
Furthermore, it was also indicated in the related research  that if the consumers perceived the importance, perceived risk,  symbolic or hedonic value of the product, their involvement will  be increased too [28]. It can also be found from similar research  that when the consumers perceived that the message provided  by other people is valuable, they will consider rationally and  carefully the substance value provided by the message [45],  hence, the involvement will be increased, which in turn will  affect their attitude and behavior. For example, Groupon held a  one-day special offer on their website that allowed consumers to  buy 50 USD coupons for 25 USD. Before the event, they sent a  message to 15 million members and the Facebook fans groups  of other enterprises. The outcome of the promotion was the sale  of about 10 million coupons within one day, showing that it was  very effective. 
H6: When browsing utilitarian advertising messages,  Facebookers’ involvement will be enhanced. 
In addition, the study had pointed out that involvement affects  the ways used to interpret and provide feedback on the messages  [24], while promoting the level of personal effort to take action  on various targets or scenarios [9]. The study have confirmed  that high involvement features will lead the consumer to enter  more excitingly important environments and urge the consumer  to further infer and consider the message, thereby strengthening  the perception and memory of the advertising messages [9].  Compared with low involvement, high involvement has a higher  correlation with brand attitudes and purchasing intentions [25,  37]. For example, Huang et al. [21] studied the effects of the  involvement of Bloggers on advertising effects, finding that  higher involvement results in better advertising attitude and brand  attitudes. Bosnjak et al. [5], in a survey of online shopping factors,  also found that consumer involvement is the major determinant  factor affecting online shopping.  
H7: Facebookers’ involvement will affect advertising  attitude, brand attitudes and purchasing intentions. 
2.1.4 Mediating effects of involvement 
Zaichkowsky’s [53] research pointed out that the  communication message content will affect involvement of the  consumers, which in turn will affect their attitude and behavior.  It was implied the marketing communication model in the
52 Journal of Computer Information Systems Spring 2012 
CME as constructed in Hoffman & Novak [20] that the involve ment has mediating effect, in other words, it might mediate  the effect of recreational or utilitarian benefit on the behavior.  Therefore, certain type of message might increase the involve ment of the consumers [33, 45, 55], which will in turn affect the  advertising attitude, brand attitudes and purchasing intentions  [21, 25, 37].  
H8: Facebookers’ involvement will mediate the effects  of recreational advertising messages on advertising  attitude, brand attitudes and purchasing intentions. 
H9: Facebookers’ involvement will mediate the effects of  utilitarian advertising messages on advertising attitude,  brand attitudes and purchasing intentions. 
3. RESEARCH METHOD 
3.1 Pretest 
First, to select the appropriate products as the research sub jects and avoid the variance of samples regarding the in volvement level of certain products, this study invited 52 students from a certain metropolitan college of continuing  
education in Taiwan to answer a personal involvement scale  questionnaire. The products of minimum variance were selected as the research subjects. The surveyed products in cluded online games, desktop computers, mobile phones, digital  cameras, MP3 players, clothes and shoes. In addition, in order  to avoid the subject to guess the objective of the questionnaire  survey, the researcher explained the purpose of the questionnaire  as being used to understand product impressions. The results  suggested that mobile phones were the product of minimum  variance in terms of involvement; hence, this study selected  mobile phones as the research subject.  
At the second stage, this study executed two (high/low  recreational) × two (high/low utilitarian) between-subjects  designs. For the manipulation of the recreational and utilitarian  message content, four advertising messages were developed on  Facebook, promoting the virtual brand “Mini” mobile phone.  Since the brand recognition effect was not considered in this  study, a virtual brand was used to remove the brand factor and  the interfering effects of real brand impressions. The advertising  content was modified from the research design of [13]. The high  hedonic messages contained amusement and lottery messages  (such as the opportunity to win a Wii, iPod or 150 USD bonus).  The high utilitarian messages contained product features (such as  a 3.5 inch TFT touch screen), functionality (8 million pixels, MP3  music downloads and support for Facebook, email and GPS) and  price. Students that were unfamiliar with the subjects were invited  to participate in the study. A total of 86 subjects were randomly  assigned to use smart phones for browsing the four experi ments (treatment conditions) on Facebook. Each subject browsed one of the mobile phone advertising messages on  the Facebook website. Afterward, the survey items regarding  utilitarian and recreational values were answered using a Likert  five-point scale. This study referred to the scales designed by  three scholars [10, 13] for the design of the scales used in the  survey. For example, when measuring the recreational values, the subjects were asked to respond to: 1) I feel this message is  very interesting; 2) I feel this message has recreational value; 
3) I will feel very happy when browsing this message. When  
measuring the utilitarian values, the subjects were asked to respond to: 1) if I am going to buy a mobile phone, this message  is helpful; 2) this message makes me believe that I can save  money if I buy this mobile phone; and 3) this message can help  me understand the mobile phone functions. The Cronbach’s  alpha values for the recreational and utilitarian value scales were  respectively 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. Finally, the scores of the  individual items of recreational and utilitarian values were added  up to represent the composite scores.  
The results of the ANOVA analysis showed that advertising  messages containing amusement and lotteries had significantly  higher recreational value scores than advertising messages  without such content (10.34, with S.D. =1.95, vs. 7.91, with  S.D. =2.17, F=16.07, p<0.001). Advertising messages containing  product features, functions and prices had significantly greater  scores than advertising messages without such content (10.92,  with S.D.=1.84, vs. 8.20, with S.D.=1.99, F=11.36, p<0.01). The  measurement variables of recreational and utilitarian values after  variance and qualitative tests suggested that the variable data  were qualitatively the same.  
4. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND PROCEDURE 
This study conducted two (high/low recreational message  content) × two (high/low utilitarian message content) × three  (close friends, commercial sources, and acquaintances) between subject designs. In the formal survey, subjects were randomly  assigned to answer any of the 12 scenarios. Each respondent had  a guide who explained the experimental content and described  the specific scenario. Meanwhile, the subjects were requested  to browse any of the 12 scenarios on Facebook. The scenarios  were used to create a reasonable environment while minimizing  memory bias [33]. In this study, each scenario regarded message  sources (close friends, commercial sources, and acquaintances)  and media (Facebook) as external factors. Therefore, the subjects  were requested to go to Facebook and browse advertising messages  offered by close friends, commercial sources, and acquaintances  and then fill in the questionnaires afterward.  
4.1 Sample 
This study selected students of continuing education, with  the personal habit of using Facebook via smart phones, as the  experimental subjects. Most of the students in the college  of continuing education were from different social classes  and industries, were aged 20-40, and were the major group of smart mobile phone users. This study received a total of 300  completed questionnaires. Of these, there were 256 valid 
samples after eliminating 44 invalid samples. The average  questionnaire survey time was about 30 minutes. Female users  accounted for 55% of the total, the average age of the sub jects was 28.75 (median=28, S.D. =6.63), the average daily  Internet use was 5.37 hours (S.D.=3.30), and the average daily use of smart phones to view Facebook was 0.64 hour  (S.D.=1.39). According to a survey made by CheckFacebook. com (http://www.checkfacebook.com/) on July 2011, Taiwan’s  users of Facebook in the age range of 18~44 years old has a  percentage of 70.2%, among them, female occupies a percen tage of 49.2%, which was similar to the survey targets of this  research. The demographic characteristics as mentioned above  were similar to other studies of selecting smart phones users as  research sample (such as [14], [33]).

4.2 Questionnaire design 
4.2.1 Advertising attitude and brand attitudes  
Referring to the advertising attitude and brand attitude scale  designed by Chang & Thorson [11], this study adopted the  Semantic Differential Method to measure the feelings of the  subjects after browsing the advertising messages on Facebook,  using the following responses: “very pleasant/very unpleasant”;  “interesting/uninteresting”; “attractive/unattractive”.  
4.2.2 Purchasing intentions 
This study referred to the purchasing intention scale designed  by Jin [22], using the following question items: 1) after browsing  the message, assuming I am purchasing a mobile phone, I am  willing to buy the “Mini” brand; 2) I am interested in purchasing  the “Mini” brand mobile phone; and 3) when purchasing a mobile  phone next time, I will consider the “Mini” brand.  
4.2.3 Involvement  
This study referred to the involvement scale designed  by Zaichkowsky [54], and adopted the semantic differential  method to measure the respondent’s feelings about the mobile  phone, using the following responses: “important/unimportant”,  “related to me/not related to me”, “meaningful to me/ meaningless to me”, “valuable/valueless”, “focused input/not 
focused input”, “intriguing/boring”, “exciting/unexciting”, “attractive/unattractive”, “charming/mediocre”, and “necessary/ unnecessary”.  
Pretests of these questionnaires (along with the recreational  and utilitarian message questionnaire pretests) were conducted  with 86 students from the university promotional department,  who all had experience using Facebook. After the completion  of the questionnaires, the students were requested to provide  improvement recommendations. After removing some items (four  in the involvement perspective and one in the advertising attitude  perspective, as shown in Table 1), the Cronbach’s alpha values  of the various perspectives of the questionnaire pretests were all  above the 0.7 Nunnally criteria [36].  
5. DATA ANALYSIS 
5.1 Manipulation test 
The subjects were asked to assess the credibility of  the messages from close friends, commercial sources, or  acquaintances on Facebook. In addition, six question items were  adopted to measure the recreational and utilitarian values. All  the measurement question items were measured using a Likert  5-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).  
The ANOVA main effects suggested that the scores of the  subjects, regarding the message source credibility, recreational  message and utilitarian message, all reached a significant  level (message source F=9.28; recreational message F=20.97;  utilitarian message F=11.64, and all of the p values were lower  than 0.001).  
Regarding the manipulation of the variable for message  source, this study found that the credibility of close friends as a  source was significantly higher than that of acquaintances (13.02,  with S.D.=2.13, vs. 10.82, with S.D.=2.09; p<0.01), however  
there was no significant difference from the commercial source  credibility (13.02 vs. 12.70 (1.83), p>0.05), meanwhile, the  commercial source credibility was also significantly higher than  that of acquaintances (12.70 vs. 10.82, p<0.01). This differed  from the research conclusions of Chiu et al. (2007) [13]. Their  study found that the credibility of close friends was significantly  higher than that of acquaintances and commercial sources, and  there was no significant difference between acquaintance sources  and commercial sources [13]. People usually are familiar with  those they communicate with by email, and they usually regard  advertising mail from commercial sources as spam. However,  as mentioned above, this study believed consumers may join  Facebook fan groups for some brands due to their brand  preferences. Hence, the credibility of the advertising messages  for those brands would be higher than that from acquaintances. In  summary, the manipulation of the message source credibility of  this study was in line with expectations.  
Regarding the manipulation of recreational and utilitarian  advertising messages, this study found, recreational (M high =10.27, S.D.=2.07; Mlow=8.10, S.D.=2.16; F=20.97; p<0.001)  and utilitarian (M high=10.50, S.D.=1.98; M low=8.75, S.D.=2.09; F =11.64; p<0.001) advertising messages got rela tively high points for recreational and utilitarian values. Hence,  the manipulation of the message content variables of this study  was in line with expectations.  
5.2 Confirmatory factor analysis 
This study calculated the Cronbach’s alpha values to test the  internal consistency of the constructs. As shown in Table 1, all the  Cronbach’s alpha values were above the 0.7 Nunnally criteria [37].  Next, LISREL 8.5 was used to implement the confirmatory factor  analysis and test the internal fitness of the model. First, the fitness  indicator was used to judge the fitness between the overall model  and the observation data. The findings suggested χ2/df=1.75 (<5,  χ2=124.8, df=71), NNFI=0.96, CFI=0.97, and RMSEA=0.064  (<.08), indicating that the research model and observation data  had very good fitness for various tests of the internal fitness of  the model, which was consistent with the recommended criteria  proposed by Hair et al. [18].  
To test the validity of the measurement model, this study  tested the convergent validity and the discriminant validity  [21]. Regarding the convergent validity, this study tested the  observation variables’ three major indicators, including the factor  loading, potential variable AVE and construct reliability. Fornell  & Larcker [18] believed that if the factor loading >0.5, AVE>0.5,  and CR>0.6, then the variables and constructs would have good  validity. As shown in Table 1, the minimum factor loading value  of the various question items was 0.71. As shown in Table 2, the  AVE values of the various constructs ranged from 0.64 to 0.69,  and the CR values ranged from 0.81 to 0.92, which were all above  the recommended values proposed by Fornell & Larcker [18].  This suggested that the questionnaire items of the scale proposed  in this study had convergent validity.  
Regarding the discriminant validity, the AVE values of the  constructs should be above the correlation coefficient of the model  (non-diagonal values) [12]. As shown in Table 2, the diagonal  values were all bigger than the non-diagonal values, indicating that  all constructs had discriminant validity. Next, Table 2 illustrated  that the correlation coefficients of some constructs were relatively  high, which could lead to multicollinearity (such as the correlation  coefficient between brand attitudes and advertising attitudes at 
54 Journal of Computer Information Systems Spring 2012 
0.77). Hence, this study tested VIF (variance inflation factor)  (coefficient value in between 1 and 2.38). The results suggested  that the VIF values were all lower than the recommended value  of 10 proposed by Hair et al. (1995) [19], showing there was no  multicollinearity between the various constructs.  
5.2.1 Hypothesis testing  
After addressing the measurement model, this study adopted  the regression model to test the hypotheses. A regression model  can process the antecedent quantitative and qualitative indepen 
dent variables [13], and can estimate the effects of mediating  variables [4]. This study selected the advertising attitude, brand  attitudes and purchasing intentions as dependent variables, the  message sources, recreational message content and utilitarian  message content as the antecedent independent variables, and  involvement as the mediating variable. The following two  variables were designed as dummy variables in order to con 
duct coding: recreational message content (high: 0; low: 1);  utilitarian message content (high: 1; low: 0). In addition, as  there were three types of message sources, two dummy vari ables (source 1, source 2) were designed to represent each

As shown in Table 3, when browsing the advertising messages  provided by close friends, the brand attitudes will significantly  increase (H1b, βBA =.16, p<.05); when browsing the advertising  messages from commercial sources, the brand attitudes and  purchasing intentions of Facebookers will increase significantly  (see RM 2, H2b, βBA =.22, p<.01; H2c, βPI =.16, p<.05). When  browsing recreational advertising messages, the advertising  attitude, brand attitudes, purchasing intentions and involvement  of Facebookers will significantly increase (see RM 1 and RM 2,  H3a, ΒAA =.41, p<.001; H3b, βBA =.35, p<.001; H3c, βPI =.16,  p<.05; H5, ΒI =.18, p<.05); when browsing utilitarian advertising  messages, the advertising attitude, brand attitudes, purchasing  intentions and involvement of Facebookers will significantly  increase (see RM 1 and RM 2, H4a, BAA =.28, p<.01; H4b, βBA =.29, p<.01; H4c, βPI =.19, p<.05; H6, ΒI =.18, p<.05).  Furthermore, Facebooker involvement will significantly affect  the advertising attitude, brand attitudes and purchasing intentions  (see RM 3, H7a, βAA =.31, p<.001; H7b, βBA =.31, p<.001; H7c, βPI =.21, p<.01).  
Regarding the testing of mediating effects, this study referred  to the methods proposed by Baron & Kenny [4] and Muller et  al. [35] to address the mediating variables when implementing  the three types of regression models. The results were as follows  (as shown in Table 3): (1) the antecedent independent variables  had significant effects on the dependent variables (RM 2); (2)  the antecedent independent variables had significant effects on  the mediating variables (RM 1); and (3) when the mediating  variables were integrated into RM 3, the effects of the antecedent  independent variables would be significantly lower or would  disappear. Namely, when all the antecedent independent variables  of RM 2 were integrated into the mediating variables for regression  (RM 3), all the antecedent independent variable coefficients  would be significantly reduced [35]. This indicated that consumer  involvement would partially mediate the relationships between  the advertising message and advertising attitude, brand attitudes  and purchasing intentions (H8, H9).  
5.2.2 Discussions and Suggestions 
Many enterprises have been using Facebook to conduct  marketing activities to promote brand image and product/service  
sales [48]. However, the understanding of Facebooker’s decision making behavior has been considerably inadequate. This study  referred to source credibility [52], social ties [6, 46], consumer  value [1, 10, 49] and involvement [37, 53] to test the factors  affecting Facebookers’ decision-making behavior. The research  conclusions are worth following to those who are interested in  Facebook marketing, as the integration and applications of the  research findings and these theories can improve Facebook  marketing effectiveness and affect consumer decision-making  behavior.  
The regression model testing suggested that these theories had  significant effects on consumer involvement, advertising attitude,  brand attitudes and purchasing intentions (all p<0.01), and could  explain the involvement variance at 13%, advertising attitude  at 25%, brand attitudes at 26% and purchasing intentions at  23%. Specifically, message sources (the communicator factors),  utilitarian and recreational messages (message content factor)  and involvement (the receiver factor) would affect Facebook  marketing effectiveness and consumer decision-making behavior.  The research findings were broadly consistent with the conclusions  of previous studies.  
5.2.2.1. Message source and  
consumer decision-making behavior 
With respect to the relationship between message source  and consumer decision-making behavior, the research findings  were broadly consistent with the expectations of this study:  (1) the advertising messages provided by close friends on  Facebook will enhance the message receiver’s brand attitudes;  (2) the advertising messages provided by commercial sources on  Facebook will enhance the message receiver’s brand attitudes and  purchasing intentions (see Table 3, RM 2). Baker & Churchill [3]  had pointed out that highly credible message sources will induce  more immediate attitude changes, however, the advertising  message of commercial source will affect the decision making  behavior of the consumer, which is in contradiction partially to  the past theoretical point of view. The theory of social ties states  that message sources with strong ties, such as close friends, has  a greater influence on the message receiver than those with weak  ties, such as commercial sources and acquaintances [6]. However,  the research conclusions of this study found that the advertising  messages provided by commercial sources had a greater influence

on the message receiver than those provided by close friends (see  Table 3, the regression coefficients of RM 2). This indicated  that message sources with weak ties had a significant impact  on the message receiver. This conclusion is consistent with the  conclusion made by the study (word of mouth forum) of Steffes  & Burgee [42], namely, the influential power of the message  provided by weak tie sometimes is larger than that of strong tie or  the message source of face to face communication. 
There were two possible explanations for these results. First  was the impact arising from the media feature variance: as  Facebook has diversified interactivities (such as one to multiple  and multiple to multiple interactions) and functionalities (such  as a graffiti wall, albums, videos, blogs, posting links, discussion  forums and application programming interfaces), enterprises can  establish and keep relationships with consumers on the platform  [40]. Hence, with the long-term application of Facebook websites  to provide various incentives and regular interactions with  consumers, consumers can easily generate better brand attitudes  and higher purchasing intentions regarding the advertising  messages provided by enterprises. The second reason was,  according to the AIDA model (attention, interest, desire, action)  point of view, when consumers are interested in certain products,  they will easily generate desire or action [26]. Therefore, when  Facebookers join Facebook fans groups due to brand preferences,  the brand advertising messages may affect consumer brand  attitudes and purchasing intentions.  
This study suggested, as said by [15], Facebook is a low cost,  low threshold and easy to use platform as well as an excellent  tool to build brands, strengthen relationships and promote brand  image. Hence, enterprises should spare no effort in attracting  consumers to join Facebook fan groups and broadcast the various  advertising messages or marketing activities on Facebook to  their close friends, thereby bringing word of mouth effects into  play and further affecting consumer brand attitudes. In addition,  enterprises can contact communicators with high credibility,  such as opinion leaders, market mavens [51] or influential SNS  (such as Facebook, Myspace, Plurk, Twitter) users [46], who can  broadcast marketing messages more efficiently to improve brand  attitudes and purchasing intentions.  
5.2.2.2. Message content and  
consumer decision-making behavior 
With respect to the relationship between message content  and consumer decision-making behavior, the research findings  were consistent with the expectations of this study: when the  Facebookers browsed the advertising messages contains higher  degrees of utilitarian and recreational values, the involvement,  advertising attitude, brand attitudes and purchasing intentions  would increase (see Table 3 RM 1, RM 2). The study had pointed  out that the reason for consumers to participate in online discussion  forums and to browse online comments is to save decision making  time and lower purchasing risks [51]. Hence, if they find valuable  product messages (such as product promotion information), their  attitudes and purchasing intentions will increase significantly [7].  In addition, recreational messages will also affect Facebooker  decision-making behavior. For example, Nike implemented a  series of Facebook hedonic advertising activities successfully  increased the sales volume of the new products by 30% in the  Netherlands [48].  
In summary, this study suggested that enterprises should  assign management staff to manage various SNS’s, and should  
regularly provide product/service-related utilitarian (such as  product promotional projects) [45]or recreational messages  (such as interactive games) [31] to enhance consumer product  involvement [32, 45]), advertising attitude, brand attitudes and  purchasing intentions [21, 25, 37].  
5.2.2.3. Involvement and consumer  
decision-making behavior  
With respect to the relationship between involvement and  decision-making behavior, the research findings were consistent  with the expectations of this study: (1) Facebooker involvement  (the receiver factor) will affect the advertising attitude, brand  attitudes and purchasing intentions of consumers; and (2) it  will mediate the effects of utilitarian advertising messages and  recreational advertising messages on the advertising attitude,  brand attitudes and purchasing intentions (see Table 3, RM 1 to  RM 3). Consumer involvement plays very important role, in other  words, it will not only affect consumer’s decision making, but  also possess mediating effect. The mediating role of involvement  originated with the marketing communication model proposed by  [20]. However, this viewpoint was only a conceptual inference  without the support of empirical data. Although some scholars  have confirmed the relationships of the above five variables using  empirical data [21, 25, 32, 37, 44, 53, 55], the five variables have  never been integrated into a single model for analysis.  
In summary, this study suggested that enterprises should spare  no effort in considering how to use utilitarian or recreational  advertising messages to enhance consumer involvement [33, 44].  More importantly, enterprises should think about how to provide  necessary messages for consumers browsing Facebook, in order  to keep their involvement and get them into the flow state [20].  Hence, when consumer involvement increases, the advertising  attitude, brand attitudes and purchasing intentions will also  increase naturally [21, 25, 37].  
5.2.3 Future Studies 
This study proposed suggestions for future studies. First, future  research may investigate other important SNS’s and compare the  determinant factors of decision-making behavior for consumers  using different SNS’s, in order to establish the general management  principles of SNS marketing. Second, future studies may discuss  the features of influential communicators in SNS’s. Strahilevitz  & Myers [44] proposed that influential communicators in SNS’s  account for only 22% of the users. However, the understanding  of such Facebook communicators (such as psychological and  statistical variables) is still inadequate. It is important for  enterprises to find target groups and lock them in for marketing  [38]. This study suggested that scholars may further develop  scales to measure influential Facebook communicators and  discuss their behavioral features in the future. Third, regarding  the overall process from new product introduction to recession,  the effects of Facebook word of mouth marketing activities on  consumer word of mouth content, and the changes in number and  impact, may be analyzed to develop a management strategy for  Facebook word of mouth marketing [27].
