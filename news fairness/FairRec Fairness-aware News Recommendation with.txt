Abstract
Recommend

News recommendation is important for online news services.
Existing news recommendation models are usually learned
from users’ news click behaviors. Usually the behaviors of
users with the same sensitive attributes (e.g., genders) have
similar patterns and news recommendation models can easily
capture these patterns. It may lead to some biases related to
sensitive user attributes in the recommendation results, e.g.,
always recommending sports news to male users, which is
unfair since users may not receive diverse news information.
In this paper, we propose a fairness-aware news recommendation approach with decomposed adversarial learning and
orthogonality regularization, which can alleviate unfairness
in news recommendation brought by the biases of sensitive
user attributes. In our approach, we propose to decompose
the user interest model into two components. One component aims to learn a bias-aware user embedding that captures
the bias information on sensitive user attributes, and the other
aims to learn a bias-free user embedding that only encodes
attribute-independent user interest information for fairnessaware news recommendation. In addition, we propose to apply an attribute prediction task to the bias-aware user embedding to enhance its ability on bias modeling, and we apply adversarial learning to the bias-free user embedding to remove
the bias information from it. Moreover, we propose an orthogonality regularization method to encourage the bias-free user
embeddings to be orthogonal to the bias-aware one to better
distinguish the bias-free user embedding from the bias-aware
one. For fairness-aware news ranking, we only use the biasfree user embedding. Extensive experiments on benchmark
dataset show that our approach can effectively improve fairness in news recommendation with minor performance loss.

tention networks to learn user representations from the representations of clicked news by using the embedding of user
ID as attention query. Usually, users with the same sensitive
attributes (e.g., genders) may have similar patterns in their
news click behaviors. Taking user genders as an example, in
Fig. 1 the female users may prefer fashion news while male
users may prefer sports news. However, user interest models can easily capture the these patterns and lead to some
biases (e.g., gender bias) in the news recommendation results. For example, as shown in Fig. 1, since fashion news
may be clicked by more female users while NBA news may
be preferred more by male users, the model tends to only
recommend fashion news to female users and NBA news to
male users. In this scenario, the recommendation results are
heavily influenced by the biases brought by sensitive user
attributes, and the users interested in both fashion and NBA
cannot receive diverse news information, which is unfair and
may be harmful for user experience.
In this paper, we propose a fairness-aware news
recommendation (FairRec) approach with decomposed adversarial learning and orthogonality regularization, which
can effectively alleviate the unfairness in news recommendation brought by the biases related to sensitive user attributes like genders. We propose to decompose the user interest model into two components, where the first one aims
to learn a bias-aware user embedding that captures biases
related to sensitive user attributes from user behaviors, and
the second one aims to learn a bias-free user embedding
that mainly encodes attribute-independent user interest information for making fairness-aware news recommendation.
In addition, we apply a sensitive user attribute prediction
task to the bias-aware user embedding to push it to convey

Introduction
Personalized news recommendation techniques are critical
for news websites to help users find their interested news
and improve their reading experience (Wu et al. 2019d).
Many existing methods for news recommendation rely on
the news click behaviors of users to learn user interest models (Okura et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2019b). For example, Okura
et al. (2017) proposed to learn user representations from the
representations of clicked news articles with a GRU network. Wu et al. (2019b) proposed to use personalized atCopyright c 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artificial

Some studies explore the problem of provider-side fairness,
e.g., items from different providers have a fair chance of being recommended (Lee et al. 2014; Kamishima et al. 2014;
Liu et al. 2019). There are also several methods that address the problem of customer-side fairness, e.g., provide
similar recommendations for users with different sensitive
attributes (Xiao et al. 2017; Zhu, Hu, and Caverlee 2018;
Burke, Sonboli, and Ordonez-Gauger 2018). Many methods study customer-side fairness on e-commerce scenarios
by using ratings to indicate fairness (Yao and Huang 2017).
For example, Yao and Huang (2017) proposed four different metrics based on the predicted and real ratings of users
with different attributes to measure unfairness. They proposed to regularize collaborative filtering models with one
of the unfairness metrics to explore the model performance
in minimizing each form of unfairness. Farnadi et al. (2018)
proposed to use probabilistic soft logic (PSL) rules to balance the ratings for both users in different groups by unbiasing the ratings for each item. These methods mainly aim
to balance the recommendation performance for users with
different sensitive attributes. Geyik, Ambler, and Kenthapadi (2019) explored several re-ranking rules to provide fair
rankings of LinkedIn users based on their ranking scores and
the desired proportions over different user attributes. This
method aims to provide fair rankings of users with different
attributes. Different from these methods, our approach focuses on the fairness of news recommendation results rather
than accuracy, and we need to rank news rather than users.
We propose a decomposed adversarial learning method to
learn bias-free user embeddings, which is used to generate
fairness-aware news recommendation results.

more bias information, and we apply adversarial learning
techniques to the bias-free user embedding to eliminate its
information on sensitive user attributes. Moreover, we propose an orthogonality regularization method to encourage
the bias-free user embedding to be orthogonal to the biasaware one, which can further remove the information related
to sensitive attributes from the bias-free user embedding. To
achieve fairness-aware news recommendation, we only use
the bias-free user embedding for personalized news ranking.
We conduct experiments on a benchmark news recommendation dataset, and the results show that our approach can
effectively improve news recommendation fairness with acceptable performance sacrifice.
The major contributions of this paper include:
• This is the first work that explores to improve fairness
in news recommendation by proposing a fairness-aware
news recommendation framework.
• We propose a decomposed adversarial learning method
with orthogonality regularization to learn bias-free user
embeddings for fairness-aware news ranking.
• Extensive experiments on real-world dataset demonstrate
that our approach can effectively improve fairness in news
recommendation.

Related Work
News Recommendation
News recommendation is an essential technique for online
news platform to provide personalized news services. Accurately modeling of user interest is critical for news recommendation (Wu et al. 2019b). In many existing news
recommendation methods, the interest of users is modeled
by their news click behaviors (Wang et al. 2018; Wu et al.
2019a; Zhu et al. 2019; An et al. 2019; Wu et al. 2019b,c;
Qi et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020; Hu et al. 2020). For example, Okura et al. (2017) proposed to use a GRU network to learn user representations from the representations
of clicked news. Wang et al. (2018) proposed to learn user
representations based on the relevance between the representations of clicked and candidate news. Wu et al. (2019c)
proposed to learn user representations from clicked news
via multi-head self-attention networks. These existing methods usually learn news recommendation models from users’
news click behaviors. However, their models can easily
grasp the similar patterns in the behaviors of users with the
same sensitive attributes and lead to biased news recommendation results. Thus, the users may not receive diverse news
information, which is harmful to user experience. Different
from these methods, in our approach we propose a decomposed adversarial learning approach with orthogonality regularization to learn bias-free user embeddings for fairnessaware news ranking, which can substantially improve news
recommendation fairness with small performance sacrifice.

Methodology
In this section, we first present the problem definitions of
this paper, then introduce the details of our fairness-aware
news recommendation framework with decomposed adversarial learning and orthogonality regularization.

Problem Definition
For a target user u with the sensitive attribute z, we assume
that she has clicked N news articles, which are denoted
as D = {D1 , D2 , ..., DN }. We denote the candidate news
c
set for this user as Dc = {D1c , D2c , ..., DM
}, where M is
the number of candidate news. The gold click labels of the
target user u clicking these candidate news are denoted as
[y1 , y2 , ..., yM ]. The click labels predicted by the news recommendation model are denoted as [ŷ1 , ŷ2 , ..., ŷM ]. Candidate news are sorted by these predicted click labels, and the
top K ranked candidate news set (regarded as the recommendation result) is denoted as Dr = {Dic1 , Dic2 , ..., DicK }.
The unfairness of the recommendation result Dr is defined
as how discriminative it is for inferring the sensitive user attribute z. If z can be predicted from Dr more accurately, the
recommendation result is more unfair since it is more heavily influenced by the sensitive user attribute.

Fairness-aware Recommendation

Framework of FairRec

The problem of fairness in recommendation has attracted
much attention in recent years (Beutel et al. 2019; Ekstrand,
Burke, and Diaz 2019; Fu et al. 2020; Patro et al. 2020).

First, we introduce the framework of the proposed fairnessaware news recommendation (FairRec) method, as shown

in Fig. 2. It mainly aims to compute a fairness-aware news
ranking score for each candidate news of a user, which is
further used to rank candidate news and generate fairnessaware news recommendation results for this user. More
specifically, our FairRec framework uses a news model to
learn the embeddings of candidate news, a bias-free user
model to learn the bias-free embeddings of users which minimally contain the bias information on the sensitive user attribute, and a click scoring model to compute the fairnessaware news ranking scores based on the bias-free user embedding and candidate news embeddings. We briefly introduce these components as follows.
The news and user models in our approach are based on
those in the NRMS (Wu et al. 2019c) method. The news
model learns news representations from news titles. It first
uses a multi-head self-attention network to capture the contexts of words within a news title, and then uses an attentive pooling network to learn news representations by modeling the importance of different words. We denote the representation of the candidate news Dc learned by the news
model as ec . The user model learns the representation of
a target user u from her clicked news [D1 , D2 , ..., DN ]. It
first uses a news model to learn the representations of these
clicked news, then uses a combination of multi-head selfattention network and attentive pooling network to obtain
the unified user representations. We denote the bias-free user
embedding learned by this user model as ud . Finally, the
click scoring module computes the fairness-aware ranking
score ŷ based on the bias-free user embedding ud and the
candidate news embedding ec . Following many previous
methods (Okura et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2019b), we use the
dot product function to compute the fairness-aware ranking
score by evaluating the relevance between the bias-free user
embedding and candidate news embedding, i.e., ŷ = ud · ec .

The ranking scores of candidate news are further used for
personalized news ranking and display.

Decomposed Adversarial Learning with
Orthogonality Regularization
Then, we introduce the details of the proposed decomposed adversarial learning and orthogonality regularization method for learning bias-free user embeddings. In our
fairness-aware recommendation framework, a core problem
is how to learn the bias-free user embedding ud from users’
news click behaviors. However, since the users with the
same sensitive attribute usually have some similar patterns
in their news click behaviors, the user model can easily capture these patterns from users’ news click behaviors and generate biased user embeddings. Thus, it is non-trivial to learn
bias-free user embeddings from the biased user behaviors.
Adversarial learning is a technique that can be used
to learn bias-free deep representations from biased
data (Madras et al. 2018; Elazar and Goldberg 2018). Its
mission is to enforce the deep representations to be maximally informative for predicting the labels of the main task,
and meanwhile to be minimally discriminative for predicting sensitive attributes (Du et al. 2019). Thus, adversarial
learning has the potential to learn bias-free user embeddings
by removing the bias information about sensitive user attributes. A straightforward way is to apply an attribute discriminator to the user embeddings learned by the user model
to infer the sensitive user attribute, and penalize the model
according to the negative gradients from the adversarial loss
that indicates the informativeness of user embeddings for
sensitive user attribute prediction. At the same time, the
user embeddings are also used to evaluate the relevance between the user and candidate news for news recommendation model training. Unfortunately, users’ sensitive attributes
4464

may be informative for the main news recommendation task,
and the bias information related to the sensitive user attribute
may be encoded into the user embeddings, making it difficult to be removed by adversarial learning. As an alternate,
we propose to decompose the user interest model into two
components, i.e., a bias-aware one that mainly aims to learn
bias-aware user embeddings that capture the bias information on sensitive user attributes, and a bias-free one that only
encodes the attribute-independent information of user interest into bias-free user embeddings. To push the bias-aware
user embedding to be more attribute-discriminative, we propose to apply a sensitive attribute prediction task to the biasaware user embedding. The user attribute z is predicted by
an attribute predictor as follows1 :
ẑ = softmax(Wb ub + bb ),
b

bias-free user embedding by encouraging them to be orthogonal to each other. The regularization loss function is formulated as follows:
U
1 X
ub · ud
(5)
LD =
| b i i d |,
U i=1 ||ui || · ||ui ||
where ubi and udi are respectively the bias-aware and biasfree embeddings of the i-th user.

Model Training
Finally, we introduce how to train the models in our approach. In our FairRec framework, the bias-aware user embedding mainly contains the information on sensitive user
attribute, and the bias-free user embedding mainly encodes
attribute-independent user interest information. The information in both embeddings is correlated with the main recommendation task.2 Thus, we add both user embeddings together to form a unified one for training the recommendation
model, i.e., u = ub + ud . We denote the representation of
the candidate news Dc as ec , which is encoded by the news
model. The probability of a user u clicking news Dc is predicted by ŷ = u · ec . Following (Huang et al. 2013; Wu et al.
2019c), we use negative sampling techniques to construct labeled samples for news recommendation model training. For
each candidate news clicked by a user, we randomly sample
T negative news in the same session which are not clicked.
The loss function for news recommendation is the negative
log-likelihood of the posterior click probability of clicked
news, which is formulated as follows:

(1)

b

where W and b are parameters, ẑ is the predicted probability vector. The loss function for attribute prediction is
crossentropy, which is formulated as:
U

LG = −

C

1 XX j
z log(ẑij ),
U j=1 i=1 i

(2)

where zij and ẑij respectively stand for the gold and predicted
probability of the j-th user’s attribute in the i-th class, and
U is the number of users.
Usually, the supervision of the main recommendation task
may also encode the bias information about sensitive user attribute into the bias-free user embedding. Thus, in order to
eliminate the bias information, we propose to apply adversarial learning to the bias-free user embedding. More specifically, we use a attribute discriminator to predict user attributes according to the bias-free user embedding as follows:
z̃ = softmax(Wd ud + bd ),
(3)
d
where W and bd are parameters. The adversarial loss function of the discriminator is similar to the attribute predictor,
which is formulated as follows:
U

LA = −

N

c
1 X
exp(ŷi )
LR = −
],
log[
PT
Nc i=1
exp(ŷi ) + j=1 exp(ŷi,j )

where ŷi and ŷi,j are the click scores of the i-th clicked candidate news and its associated j-th negative news, respectively. Nc is the number of clicked candidate news for training. The entire framework is trained collaboratively, and the
final loss function for the recommendation model (except
the discriminator) is a weighted summation of the news recommendation, attribute prediction, orthogonality regularization and adversarial loss functions, which is formulated as
follows:

C

1 XX j
z log(z̃ij ).
U j=1 i=1 i

(4)

To avoid the discriminator from inferring user attributes
from the bias-free user embedding, we use the negative gradients of the discriminator to penalize the model.
Unfortunately, the bias-free user embedding may still
contain some information related to the sensitive user attribute. This is because the discriminator usually cannot perfectly infer the sensitive user attribute, and there are shifts
between the decision boundary of the discriminator and the
real distribution of the sensitive user attribute. Since the biasfree user embedding generated by the user model only needs
to cheat the discriminator, it does not necessarily fully remove the information of sensitive user attributes. To solve
this problem, we propose an orthogonality regularization
method to further purify the bias-free user embedding. Concretely, it regularizes the bias-aware user embedding and

Experiments
Dataset and Experimental Settings
In our experiments, we focus on gender parity in validating
the effectiveness of our fairness-aware news recommendation approach. The dataset used in our experiments is provided by (Wu et al. 2019d), which contains the news impression logs of users and their gender labels (if available).
2
In fact, bias-independent user interest information may also
exist in both kinds of user embeddings. We will explore how to
push the bias-independent user interests to be maximally captured
by the bias-free user embedding in our future work.

We assume the attribute is a categorical variable here.

news recommendation method that employs autoencoders
to learn news representations and a GRU network to generate user representations; (3) DKN (Wang et al. 2018), using
knowledge-aware CNNs to encode news representations and
the relevance between representations of clicked news and
candidate news to build user representations; (4) DAN (Zhu
et al. 2019), using CNN to learn news representations and
attentive LSTM to form user representations; (5) NPA (Wu
et al. 2019b), using personalized attention networks to learn
news and user representations; (6) NRMS (Wu et al. 2019c),
using a combination of multi-head self-attention and additive attention to learn news and user representations. In addition, we compare the recommendation fairness of several additional methods, including: (7) MR (Yao and Huang 2017),
using an unfairness loss to regularize our recommendation
model. We regard the predicted click scores as “ratings”; (8)
AL (Wadsworth, Vera, and Piech 2018), applying adversarial learning to the single user embedding; (9) ALGP (Zhang,
Lemoine, and Mitchell 2018), using gradients projection in
adversarial learning. (10) Random, ranking candidate news
randomly, which is used to show the ideal recommendation
fairness. The recommendation fairness of different methods
under K = 1, 3, 5 or 10 and their recommendation performance are respectively shown in Tables 2 and 3. From the
results, we have several observations.
First, compared with random ranking, the recommendation results of most methods are biased. This is possibly because users with the same attributes such as demographics usually have similar patterns in their behaviors,
and user models may inherit these biases and encode them
into the news ranking results. Second, compared with the
methods that do not consider the fairness of recommendation (e.g., DAN, NPA and NRMS), fairness-aware methods
(MR, AL, ALGP and FairRec) yield better recommendation
fairness. Among them, the methods based on adversarial
learning techniques perform better than the model regularization (MR) method that uses an unfairness loss to regularize the model. It shows that adversarial learning is more
effective in improving the fairness of recommendation results by reducing the bias information in user embeddings.
Third, compared with AL and ALGP, our approach achieves
better recommendation fairness with a substantial margin.
This may be because in AL and ALGP there are shifts between the decision boundaries of their discriminators and the
real attribute distributions. Since the bias-free user embeddings only need to deceive the discriminator, they may not
be orthogonal to the space of sensitive user attribute, which
means that the bias information is not fully removed. Our approach uses a decomposed adversarial learning method with
orthogonality regularization, which can learn bias-free user
embeddings more effectively. Fourth, our approach can effectively improve recommendation fairness and meanwhile
keep good recommendation performance. Compared with
random ranking, our approach can almost achieve comparable recommendation fairness under different K. In addition,
the recommendation performance of our approach is quite
competitive. It outperforms several strong baseline methods like DKN and DAN, and the performance sacrifice is
not large compared with its basic model NRMS that does

Table 1: Statistics of the dataset.

It contains 10,000 users and their news browsing behaviors
(from Dec. 13, 2018 to Jan. 12, 2019), and 4,228 users provide their gender label (2,484 male users and 1,744 female
users). For the users without gender labels, the attribute prediction and adversarial losses are deactivated. The logs in the
last week are used for test, and the rest are used for model
training. In addition, we randomly sample 10% of training
logs for validation. The statistics of this dataset are summarized in Table 1.
In our experiments, pre-trained Glove (Pennington,
Socher, and Manning 2014) embeddings are used to initialize the word embeddings. Adam (Kingma and Ba 2015) is
used as the model optimizer, and the learning rate is 0.001.
The dropout (Srivastava et al. 2014) ratio is 0.2. The loss coefficients in Eq. (7) are all set to 0.5. These hyperparameters
are tuned on the validation set.
Since the problem studied in this paper is the fairness of recommendation results rather than accuracy (He,
Burghardt, and Lerman 2020), the fairness metrics based
on user ratings used in several existing methods (Yao and
Huang 2017; Farnadi et al. 2018) may not be suitable. To
quantitatively measure the fairness of news recommendation results, we propose to use the prediction performance
of sensitive user attribute based on the top K ranked candidate news in each session as the indication of recommendation fairness. The attribute prediction model contains a user
model to learn user embeddings and an attribute predictor
with a dense layer to infer the attributes. Since the dataset
has an imbalanced gender distribution and there are system
gender biases in the impression logs brought by news recall and pre-ranking, we build a new dataset from the original dataset to better evaluate recommendation fairness. We
down-sample the number of male users to balance user gender, and use the entire news set as the candidate news set Dc
for ranking to avoid impression gender bias. We use 80%
of users for training the attribute prediction model, 10% for
validation and the rest 10% for test. Following (Wu et al.
2019d), we use accuracy and macro F-score as the metrics
to indicate fairness, where lower scores mean better recommendation fairness. To evaluate the performance of news
recommendation, we use the average AUC, MRR, nDCG5
and nDCG10 scores of test sessions. We independently repeat each experiment 10 times and report the average results
with standard deviations.

Performance Evaluation
In this section, we evaluate the performance of our FairRec
approach in terms of fairness and news recommendation. We
compare FairRec with various baseline methods for news
recommendation, including: (1) LibFM (Rendle 2012), a
popular recommendation tool based on factorization machine; (2) EBNR (Okura et al. 2017), an embedding-based

user embedding is helpful for improving the fairness of news
recommendation. This is because adversarial learning can
encourage the bias-free user embedding to minimize the information for inferring the sensitive user attributes. Third,
the orthogonality regularization added to the bias-aware and
bias-free user embeddings can also effectively improve the
recommendation fairness. It is because that this auxiliary
regularization can push the bias-free user embedding to be
orthogonal to the bias-aware user embedding and hence contains less bias information on sensitive user attributes.

Hyperparameter Analysis

65.0

In this section, we explore the influence of several critical
hyperparameters, i.e., the loss coefficients λG , λD and λA in
Eq. (7) on the fairness and performance of news recommendation. Since there are three hyperparameters, their influence
is evaluated independently. Firstly, we vary the value of λG
without the decomposition loss and adversarial learning, and
plot the fairness results under K = 10 in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b).
We see the attribute prediction task can help improve the recommendation fairness, and the improvement increases when
λG grows from 0. However, the improvement is marginal
when it is larger than 0.5, and the performance declines more
rapidly. Thus, a moderate value for λG (e.g., 0.5) may be
preferable to achieve good fairness without too heavy performance loss. Then, we vary the value of λD under λG = 0.5
and adversarial learning deactivated. The results are shown
in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b). From these results, we also find that
the recommendation fairness improves with the increasing
of λD , and the performance may decline when λD is too
large. Thus, a proper range of λD (0.3-0.6) can achieve a
good tradeoff between recommendation fairness and performance. For convenience, we choose the same value for λD
as λG , i.e., 0.5. Finally, we activate the adversarial discriminator and vary λA under λG = λD = 0.5. The results are
shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b). We find that if λA is too small
or too large, the recommendation results are less fair. This
may be because the adversaries cannot achieve an appropriate equilibrium and the attribute label is leaked to the biasfree user embedding. Thus, a moderate value of λA is also
necessary, and for convenience of hyperparameter selection,
we choose λA = λG = λD = 0.5 to avoid too heavy effort
on hyperparameter searching.

Effectiveness of Decomposed Adversarial Learning
In this section, we conduct several ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of the core components in our FairRec
approach, i.e., attribute prediction, adversarial learning and
orthogonality regularization. We compare the recommendation fairness (under K = 10) of FairRec and its variants with
one of these components removed, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 3. We have several findings from this plot. First,
applying the attribute prediction task to the bias-aware user
embedding is very important. This is because the attribute
prediction task can greatly enhance the ability of bias-aware
user embedding in bias modeling, which can help further
remove the bias information from the bias-free user embedding. Second, applying adversarial learning to the bias-free

may be interested in baseball games, and she may also have
some interests in football. However, the news about football
is assigned relatively low ranks, since football news may be
preferred more by male users. These results reflect the unfairness in news recommendation. Fortunately, Fig. 7 shows
that our approach can recommend the fashion news to male
users and NFL news to female users for better satisfying
their interest. It indicates that our approach can effectively
improve fairness in news recommendation.

Conclusion

Figure 6: The news recommendation fairness and performance w.r.t. different λA .

In this paper, we propose a fairness-aware news recommendation approach with decomposed adversarial learning and
orthogonality regularization. We propose to decompose the
user interest model into two parallel ones to respectively
learn a bias-aware user embedding that captures bias information and a bias-free user embedding for fairness-aware
news ranking. In addition, we apply an attribute prediction
task to the bias-aware user embedding to enhance its ability
on bias modeling, and apply adversarial learning techniques
to the bias-free user embedding to eliminate its bias information on user attributes. Besides, we propose an orthogonality regularization method that pushes both user embeddings to be orthogonal to each other, which can better remove user attribute information from the bias-free user embedding. Extensive experiments show that our approach can
substantially improve news recommendation fairness with
minor performance sacrifice.

Case Study
We conduct several case studies to show that our approach
can improve the fairness of news recommendation results.
We randomly select a male user and a female user, and predict the ranking scores of candidate news based on their
clicked news using NRMS and FairRec. The results are illustrated in Fig. 7. From the top table in Fig. 7, we can
infer that this male user may be interested in football and
Golden Globes. However, the NRMS method that does not
consider recommendation fairness provides a top rank for
the candidate news about sports (Cowboys WR...) while assigns candidate news about fashion (The Biggest...) a low
rank, which may be because fashion news is more likely to
be preferred by female users. However, this user may also
be interested in this news because it in fact has some inherent relatedness with the clicked news “2019 Golden Globes
Best Actress”. Similar phenomenon also exists in the ranking results of the female user. We can infer that this user
