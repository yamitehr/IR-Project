The Fairness of Media Coverage in Question:
An Analysis of Referendum Campaigns on
Welfare State Issues in Switzerland
Lionel Marquis, Hans-Peter Schaub & Marlène Gerber
University of Lausanne and University of Berne

Abstract: The mass media are assigned an important role in political campaigns on popular votes.
This article asks how the press communicates political issues to citizens during referendum campaigns, and whether some minimal criteria for successful public deliberation are met. The press coverage of all 24 ballot votes on welfare state issues from 1995 to 2004 in Switzerland is examined,
distinguishing seven criteria to judge how news coverage compares to idealized notions of the media’s role in the democratic process: coverage intensity, time for public deliberation, balance in media
coverage, source independence and inclusiveness, substantive coverage, and spatial homogeneity.
The results of our quantitative analysis suggest that the press does fulﬁl these normative requirements to a reasonable extent and that fears about biased or deceitful media treatment of ballot
issues are not well-founded. However, some potential for optimizing the coverage of referendum
campaigns by the Swiss press does exist.

Keywords: Referendum campaigns, media fairness, press coverage, welfare state, Switzerland

1. Introduction1
Instruments of direct democracy are at the heart of the Swiss political system. They are
widely used, so much in fact that Switzerland alone accounts for half of all referendums
held at the national level all over the world (Kaufmann et al. 2005; DuVivier 2006). Quite
expectedly, this unequalled degree of direct democratic practice has triggered research to
explore the determinants, conditions, and outcomes of the use of initiatives and referendums, as well as research to ﬁnd out the causes of their success or failure. For example,
Swiss scholars have directed their attention to the institutional eﬀects of the referendum on
the integration of political forces and to its role in shaping the Swiss concordance system
(e.g., Neidhart 1970; Papadopoulos 1998; Vatter 2002). Another important area of inquiry
focused on individual and aggregate citizen behaviour in referendum votes, relating voting
patterns to the level of elite support or to structural properties of campaign propaganda
(e.g., Hertig 1982; Trechsel and Sciarini 1998; Bützer and Marquis 2002).

In this study, we follow a complementary approach. Speciﬁcally, we ask how political
issues are communicated to citizens during referendum campaigns, and whether some minimal criteria for successful public deliberation are met. Our analysis is based on the press
coverage of twenty-four ballot votes on welfare issues, spanning more than two legislative
periods (1995–2004) of highest importance for the development of the Swiss welfare state.
Accordingly, our aim is to shed light on the journalistic perception of ballot campaigns.
However, the views of political actors directly involved in partisan campaigns (e.g., parties,
business associations) are also reﬂected in their agenda-building eﬀorts to capture and manage media attention. It is from the interplay between these two perspectives on the news
process — the journalists’ gatekeeping role and the elites’ agenda-building role — that the
focal questions of this study arise. What is the degree of media autonomy? How inclusive
are journalists’ accounts of the political actors involved in campaigns? How biased are their
portrayals of issues?
In the next section of the paper we present some current ideas about public deliberation
and provide theoretical insights into the structure and functions of referendum campaigns.
We thus set a number of criteria for assessing whether media campaigns may be regarded as
wise guides to sound decision-making. Section 3 then presents the empirical data collected
and the methods used for measuring the quality of media campaign coverage. Sections 4 to
7 oﬀer evidence of how journalists report on welfare state issues. We show that the press
treatment of these issues does not fall short of expectations as concerns seven distinct criteria
of ‘‘fair coverage’’. On this overall basis, we conclude in Section 8 that some fears about
skewed or deceitful media treatment of ballot issues are not justiﬁed, but also that the
communication and framing of issues does not meet all conceivable normative requirements.

2. Theoretical background: Criteria of fair media coverage
This article focuses on the ‘‘supply side’’ of referendum campaigns. Speciﬁcally, we attempt
to deﬁne a number of dimensions on which to judge the fairness and democratic utility of
the coverage of referendum issues in the Swiss media. The importance of articulating ‘‘democratic expectations of media performance’’ has been emphasized in several contributions
(e.g., Gurevitch and Blumler 1990; McLeod et al. 2002). In particular, the ‘‘social responsibility’’ of the media has attracted much attention, leading scholars to deﬁne a number of
desirable qualities of media content –– some of which may be properly regarded as ‘‘ethical’’, but others are more directly related to the functioning of democratic systems (e.g.,
Bunton 1998; Christians and Nordenstreng 2004).
Our questioning in this article takes place in the interplay of several disciplines — including media ethics and the theory of deliberative democracy. These are broad and currently
expanding disciplinary areas rather than formalized theories coupled with established methods and ﬁeldwork, as the example of deliberative theory suggests (see Bächtiger et al. 2010).
These theoretical accounts do not provide a clear and agreed-upon indication of what
media fairness should be conceived of, let alone how to measure fairness. However, to the
extent that the media are an important arena where democratic deliberation may occur, one
major conceptual distinction from deliberative theory is helpful for framing our approach
to media fairness.
Scholars in the deliberative framework usually advance that democratic decision-making
and deliberation may be appraised (and purportedly justiﬁed) either from an epistemic or
from a procedural standpoint (see Cohen 1986; Estlund 1997; List and Goodin 2001). The
distinction is captured in the question of ‘‘whether we want our political outcomes to be

right or whether we want them to be fair’’ (List and Goodin 2001: 277). To be sure, democratic processes oriented toward the search for ‘‘truth’’ or toward the observance of procedures may often bring about similar outcomes. It is nevertheless easy to imagine cases
where ‘‘correctness’’ lacks procedural fairness (e.g., one individual ‘‘rightly’’ chooses for all
others) and other cases where procedural rigidity is misplaced from procedure-independent
standards (e.g., it violates some notion of the ‘‘common good’’).
The ﬁeld of media ethics is concerned with the same kind of questions, asking whether
and how the ‘‘fairness’’ goal of media coverage can put up with the sometimes dissonant
ideal of the ‘‘correctness’’ of the views being presented — beyond the mere question of
information ‘‘accuracy’’. In this article we adopt a procedural stance and examine how media
coverage fulﬁls a number of formal rules regarding the form, provenance, and diﬀusion of
information.2 Even though correctness criteria may appear to involve considerations of a
more normative nature, it is however obvious that any set of formal-procedural rules is
itself not ‘‘given’’. As will become clear, some of the procedural criteria described below
have been the subject of considerable speculation and debate. Moreover, ‘‘fairness’’, as the
pivotal concept of procedural approaches, is to be taken here in a generic sense, as it
extends beyond the notions of fairness developed in careful theoretical analyses of ‘‘democratic proceduralism’’ (Cohen 1989; Estlund 1997).3 This enlarged concept of media fairness
posits that, whatever the media induce citizens to think and choose, they must do so within
certain procedural boundaries.
In this article we will focus on seven criteria that appear particularly relevant to evaluating the fairness of the media coverage of referendum campaigns in Switzerland. In this and
the following sections we identify these criteria at a fairly abstract level, based on the available literature, and we show how each of them provides an appropriate dimension for
assessing the achievements of campaign coverage from a normative perspective. Our goal in
this contribution is primarily comparative, as we aim at showing how fairness varies across
issue domains, across media outlets, over time, and across geographical units. Therefore,
we deliberately avoid setting precise boundaries between ‘‘fair’’ and ‘‘unfair’’ coverage. On
the other hand, the measurement of relevant criteria should be as precise and abstracted
from context as possible, in order to allow for valid and meaningful comparisons. Besides,
in order to avoid conceptual ambiguities, let us make clear that the term ‘‘fairness’’ is used
here to denote the ‘‘positive side’’ on each dimension of media coverage. Thus we do not
wish to imply, for instance, that a short, two-week campaign coverage is deliberately
‘‘unfair’’ or intended to fool voters, but only that a longer time period is more desirable
according to some formal-procedural normative standard.
Based on this broad deﬁnition, we now delineate seven speciﬁc criteria for appraising the
fairness of media campaign coverage.
2
By choosing a procedural rather than epistemic perspective, we do not mean to imply any superiority or higher
desirability of the former perspective in dealing with our subject.
3
Nevertheless, the fact that the elaboration and selection of procedural criteria is no less subjective than that of
epistemic principles does not mean that the fundamental distinction between the two types of considerations is
blurred. Generally speaking, our approach to media fairness is blind to information which may be of uttermost
importance from an epistemic perspective — the speciﬁc opinions and origins of information purveyed in media
coverage. We do not say that journalists are not (or should not be) driven by an orientation toward the common
good, as when they downplay opinions that are disruptive and threatening for the democratic order — for example,
British and German journalists have totally ignored extreme right parties in their coverage of election campaigns in
the 1980s and 1990s (Bornschier 2010: 174-5). We simply say that this reference to the explicit content and implicit
intent of media coverage is not relevant for our present purposes.

1. Suﬃcient media coverage of issues. We ﬁrst consider the information function of the
mass media and the public knowledge of political issues that is expected to stem from media
information. Learning eﬀects are extremely important from a normative perspective, since
they attest to the capacity of the people to understand politics and to exert inﬂuence on
policies, as emphasized by classical democratic theory (e.g., Berelson 1952; Kelley 1960;
Krouse and Marcus 1984; but see Pateman 1970). As a matter of fact, it has long been
shown that media exposure generates knowledge about issues and candidates, and enhances
opinion strength and attitude integration (e.g., Berelson et al. 1954: chap. 11; Delli Carpini
and Keeter 1996: chap. 5; Jerit et al. 2006). These eﬀects are usually not overwhelming, but
they are quite robust across a wide range of contexts. Accordingly, learning eﬀects have
been observed in the Swiss direct democratic context as well (Kriesi 1994; Kriesi 2005: chap.
4; Marquis 2006). Information holding, in turn, matters for political judgments and voting
decisions (Bartels 1996; Sturgis 2003). For example, a lack of knowledge causes citizens to
be more conservative on some issues and more liberal on others (Althaus 1998; Gilens
2001), and it usually prompts reliance on heuristic cues that can lead to serious misﬁts
between the people’s actual choices and their own values and interests (e.g., Kuklinski and
Quirk 2000). Therefore, the overall intensity of media campaign coverage probably matters
both for the public knowledge of issues and for the ﬁnal outcome of the ballots. In fact,
few would question that a suﬃcient amount of information is necessary for the proper functioning of democratic institutions. However, as argued below, the content of information
also deserves attention, especially as concerns value-laden information (e.g., Hofstetter
et al. 1999).
2. Suﬃcient time for public deliberation. Time is needed for the public to become
informed about the issues and to ponder the pros and cons of a ballot proposal. If all campaign coverage takes place in a last-minute avalanche, then it is unlikely to beneﬁt citizens,
however extensive it may be in terms of sheer volume. Quite logically, the inﬂuence of a
campaign usually concentrates on citizens who make up their minds during that campaign,
that is, for people whose voting decision was neither clear from the outset nor delayed until
the very last campaign days (e.g., Chaﬀee and Choe 1980; Fournier et al. 2004; Marquis
2006). Were campaigns so short-lived as to be virtually nonexistent for the purpose of
deliberation, the collective decision-making process would be essentially reduced to the use
of last-minute shortcuts (e.g., status quo bias) or of long-standing attitudes and prejudices
(e.g., a personal bias against ‘‘big government’’). The longer the referendum campaigns, the
more likely it is that the same issues will be tackled and thus the same arguments will be
repeated. In turn, this cumulative exposure may be expected to facilitate information acquisition by citizens (see Marquis and Bergman 2009). In other words, frequent exposure to
campaign information enhances the accessibility of the relevant concepts (e.g., Higgins
1996; Förster and Liberman 2007) and heightens the likelihood that they will permeate the
citizens’ voting considerations.
3. No outright bias in media coverage. A relatively unbiased media coverage of issues may
be stressed as a prerequisite for sound collective deliberation. This ‘‘impartiality’’ or ‘‘balance’’ assumption is more or less explicitly present in the writings of political philosophers
such as Arendt, Elster, and Habermas, but also in concrete experiments designed to mimic
ideal deliberative procedures (e.g., Yankelovich 1991: chap. 12; Luskin et al. 2002). Likewise, the norm of balance is deeply enmeshed in Western (primarily Anglo-American) culture and values (Schudson 2001). It looms large in the self-descriptions and perceived
professional standards of journalists (e.g., Tuchman 1972; Patterson 1998) and in academic
studies of media coverage unveiling their structural biases (e.g., Gitlin 1980; Hallin 1984;

Media Coverage of Referendum Campaigns

Lionel Marquis et al.

Entman 2004; Bennett et al. 2007).4 In addition, the development of ‘‘media watchdog journalism’’ monitoring media bias is, in part, reﬂective of the increasingly acute perception of
the media bias problem in Western societies (Graber 2006; Hayes 2008). For our present
purposes, such ‘‘issue neutrality’’ may come in several forms: the media may simultaneously
present the arguments of both sides on an issue, or they may successively alternate between
pros and cons (and thus act neutrally on an aggregate basis), or else they may restrict themselves to presenting ‘‘facts’’ and avoid matters of opinion. Meanwhile, the requirement that
there be no outright bias in media coverage must not be taken to mean that the media
should display no partisan bias, or that they should avoid expressing opinions altogether.
Actually, some bias is inevitable and probably inconsequential, provided that it is not systematic and identical across all media outlets and issues. In addition, some mix of factual
information and opinion statements is probably preferable to either one alone, for voters
most certainly need –– and look for –– both types of information to make up their minds.
As one study has shown, a voter’s general need for orientation toward media information is
codetermined by her interest in acquiring knowledge about facts and about journalistic evaluations (Matthes 2005).
4. Source independence. Similar to balance, the ‘‘source independence’’ norm implies
that the media are assigned responsibility for addressing issues in an autonomous manner.
In this case, the normative expectation is that journalists should not depend too heavily
on government, political parties and special interests for getting and framing information
on campaign issues. Actually, there is a widespread belief in Western societies, including
Switzerland, that journalists have ‘‘surrendered to complexity’’ and mainly serve as emissaries or ‘‘postmen’’, as Wuerth (1999: 373) put it. According to the ‘‘determination
hypothesis’’ and similar accounts of media-politics relationships, most news originates
from oﬃcial sources, including government and various branches of the administration,
and especially from governmental public relations activities. Such source dependency, so
the critics say, would lead to the formation of a misinformed and quiescent public (e.g.,
Baerns 1979; King and Schudson 1995; Shoemaker and Reese 1995; Bentele 2003). For
instance, Grossenbacher et al. (2006) found that the press conferences held by two Swiss
cantonal governments were indeed covered extensively by the local media, and that the
press releases issued on these occasions were often published in original or only slightly
abridged form, reproducing the local authorities’ positive self-assessments and issue priority. Likewise, more than half of the news stories in the U.S. press persistently emanate
from oﬃcial sources (e.g., Sigal 1973; Graber 2006). However, some scholars have cast
doubt on the generalizability of such ﬁndings. For instance, it was found that the parties’
press releases rarely ﬁnd their way into the German print media and ⁄ or that they are frequently altered and reframed by journalists (e.g., Donsbach and Wenzel 2002; Fröhlich
and Rüdiger 2006). To some extent, journalists and their political sources are interdependent, both from a historical perspective (Schönhagen 2008) and in terms of role relationships (Merritt 1995). Journalists themselves are ambivalent about the autonomy issue. On
the one hand, they increasingly value public relations sources and practitioners in the
4

Biased coverage may occur in relatively subtle ways, such as when the photographs of candidates in newspapers
are more or less favourable, depending on the ﬁt between the candidate’s and the paper’s political leanings (Barrett
and Barrington 2005). However, no consensus can be found in the literature as to whether media coverage is structurally biased, for instance conservative-leaning vs. liberal-leaning, or pro- vs. anti-establishment. Interestingly, the
public perception that the media are biased toward liberal views may not be due to ‘‘real-world’’ media coverage
bias, but to media self-coverage about biased media content (Watts et al. 1999).

course of their professional experience (Sallot and Johnson 2006), not least because by
creating long-term relationships with insiders they are granted routine access to valuable
ﬁrst-hand information. On the other hand, ‘‘autonomy’’ is seen as an important journalistic norm (e.g., Gurevitch and Blumler 1977; McDevitt 2003), admittedly with some important diﬀerences between national contexts (Patterson 1998; Statham 2006).5 In the present
study, we will assess to what extent journalistic accounts of the campaign issues are elaborated ‘‘independently’’ or based instead on ‘‘self-serving’’ sources of information such as
government, parties, and referendum committees.
5. Source inclusiveness. The norm of inclusion calls for the coverage of the whole diversity of viewpoints, arguments, and groups engaged in a referendum campaign. This norm
thus concerns the question of how broad the variety of sources to which journalists refer
(and which they make available to the public) should be. From another perspective, it
asks how open or restricted the access to the media should be for diﬀerent actors to
voice their standpoints toward a referendum issue. Several democratic theorists have
stressed the importance of an unrestricted and equal access for all individuals and societal groups to democratic processes in general (e.g., Dahl 1989: 119–131) and to the processes of public deliberation and will-formation in particular. The inclusiveness of the
latter is especially prominent in theories of deliberative democracy. Cohen (1989: 21–23,
30; see also Dryzek 1990; Habermas 1992) regards inclusiveness and open access as a
crucial aspect of an ‘‘ideal deliberative procedure’’.6 However, various empirical studies
have raised doubts about whether the media in reality live up to these expectations of
democratic theorists (e.g., Page 1996; Gerhards 1997; Graber 2003). Pfetsch (2004) and
Berkowitz (2009) argue that the degree of inclusiveness heavily varies depending on factors such as the cultural context, the journalists’ social characteristics, or the issue at
stake. Speciﬁcally for Swiss referendums, Marquis and Bergman (2009) report a quite
marked decrease in the variety of actors involved in advertisement campaigns in the
1990s. One reason for a low variety of sources might be the increasing commodiﬁcation
and commercialization of the media, which presses them to restrict themselves to sources
compatible with the mainstream (Meier and Jarren 2002). Second, an increasing professionalization in the PR departments of the more established political actors might raise
the hurdles for less prominent and ﬁnancially disadvantaged groups to ﬁnd their way
into the media (Gurevitch and Blumler 1990). Third, while there do exist strategies for
political ‘‘outsiders’’ to get included in a mediated political discourse, established political
actors have also developed counter-strategies to hold outsiders and their arguments oﬀ
the media attention (Kriesi 2003: 221–225). In the following analysis, we will assess the
variety of reported viewpoints by the number of diﬀerent groups of actors which journalists draw on as information sources.
6. Substantive coverage. For many observers, it is not enough that media information
be balanced and independent of special interests — in addition, it has to address the
substance of political issues. In fact, an essential part of campaign news coverage is
5

Further, journalists may feel committed to autonomy as a result of their own audiences’ support for the norm
of impartial coverage (Hargreaves and Thomas 2002) and as a result of their commitment being challenged by
‘‘popular commentators’’ such as bloggers (Singer 2007). In fact, public trust in the media may be undermined by
excessive governmental control (Connolly and Hargreaves Heap 2007).
6
The inclusion of the whole diversity of opinions and societal groups is also a core request of the so-called ‘‘diﬀerence democrats’’, who emphasize that it enhances not only the legitimacy of the opinion-building process, but also
the stock of social knowledge and information available to the participants in the public discourse, thus facilitating
well-informed and rational decisions (Young 1990: 119; 2000: 81–120; see also Connolly 1991).

Media Coverage of Referendum Campaigns

Lionel Marquis et al.

framed in terms of non-substantive features of elections, such as their ‘‘game’’ or
‘‘horserace’’ aspects, and ignores their underlying issues (e.g., Strömbäck and Dimitrova
2006). A strong case has been made against the pervasiveness and deleterious inﬂuence
of horserace information in a variety of election campaigns (e.g., Gollin 1980; Bartels
1988; Patterson 1994). We therefore only brieﬂy discuss the relevance of the issue for
the Swiss direct democratic environment. As pointed out by Rothmayr and Hardmeier
(2002) and Longchamp (1998), the practice of direct democracy in Switzerland has
inhibited rather than stimulated the development and use of opinion polls by both the
media and governmental agencies. This is because frequent and ‘‘real’’ voting results
are widely considered to provide a better account of public opinion than ‘‘unrealistic’’,
‘‘out-of-context’’ opinion polls. However, Swiss journalists may ﬁnd such polls attractive
to report, in light of the news media’s preference for the ‘‘horserace’’ aspects of campaigns and for warfare and sports narratives. Moreover, they may ﬁnd it convenient to
draw on such ready-to-use information, without paying too much attention to its technical validity and practical relevance (see Hardmeier 1999). As a way to gauge the
extent of horserace coverage, we will compare the amounts of ‘‘campaign-oriented’’ and
of ‘‘issue-oriented’’ information provided by the media.
7. Spatial homogeneity. In a multicultural society such as Switzerland, the protection
of minorities is usually a pressing issue. In addition, there is widespread concern that
direct democratic decisions might heighten the risk of some ‘‘tyranny of the majority’’
(e.g., Donovan and Bowler 1998; Hajnal et al. 2002). In Switzerland, diﬀerences between
linguistic regions, particularly as concerns voting behaviour in referendums, constitute
one of the most salient political cleavages (e.g., Kriesi 1998; Linder et al. 2008). This
cleavage is also one that is clearly identiﬁable and frequently reported on in the news
media, probably because it is conﬂict-laden and thus has a high news value (Kriesi et al.
1996; Hardmeier 2000: 388). The Swiss media system is itself highly segmented along linguistic lines (Kriesi et al. 1996; Wuerth 1999; Blum 2003; Tresch 2008), and even the
public service media ﬁnd it increasingly diﬃcult to promote national cohesion, as this
task is incompatible with economic imperatives (Meier and Schanne 1994: 37–39). In
fact, concerns about majority rule are not substantiated by empirical evidence in general
terms, as referendum voting patterns are much more homogeneous than heterogeneous
across cantonal and linguistic units (Diskin et al. 2007). In some cases, however, these
concerns may be justiﬁed, as suggested by parliamentary votes or referenda results on welfare state issues, showing support for welfare policies to be signiﬁcantly higher in the
French- than in the German-speaking region (e.g., Leuthold et al. 2007). To be sure, it is
perfectly legitimate for journalists from diﬀerent places and cultural backgrounds to pursue their own agendas, for example as they index their treatment of job issues to real or
perceived unemployment rates in their own area. Likewise, journalists may choose diﬀerent speciﬁc information ‘‘formats’’ (e.g., heavily biased ‘‘opinion’’ articles or more balanced ‘‘points of view’’ articles) depending on their cultural environment and on how
parochial the interests at stake are (e.g., Robinson 1995: 360–362). Accordingly, there is
no reason to expect equal issue coverage all over the country. However, the inﬂuence of
the media on voters can diﬀer between the linguistic areas (e.g., Kriesi 1994; Marquis
2006: 623–628). Hence, heterogeneity of media content may reinforce existing cleavages
and (re)produce undesirable tensions between linguistic communities. In the cases where
the majority group prevails, it may fuel the argument of a ‘‘tyranny of the majority’’. In
sum, small between-region variations in media coverage are arguably preferable to great
variations.

3. Methods and measurements
This study bears on the 24 ballot votes dealing with welfare state issues which were held in
Switzerland between 1995 and 2004 (see Table A1 in Appendix). Our empirical data consists of press articles collected in twenty-eight daily or weekly newspapers during an eightweek period preceding each ballot. The papers together account for a daily circulation ﬁgure of about two million copies and they are quite representative of the various Swiss
regions.7 However, they were selected mainly for availability reasons, as they are consulted
on a daily basis by the collaborators of the Anne´e Politique Suisse at the University
of Berne, Switzerland, and their content is classiﬁed into ﬁne-grained thematic categories.
It was thus easy to ﬁnd out all campaign-related articles and to code the relevant
information.
Two levels of analysis: articles and issue statements. Overall 4303 articles were found and
coded. From these, a one-quarter sample of 1088 articles was randomly selected for additional analysis of the campaign issue statements.8 A maximum of three issue statements per
article were coded, with the selection occurring on the basis of internal importance within
each article. In total, 2859 issues were coded out of our sample, making for an average of
2.63 issues per article.
Intensity and length. The number of articles and their size (in centimetres squared, then
converted in number of standard newspaper pages) were used to determine the intensity of
campaign coverage.9 Based on the date on which an article was published, the number of
days remaining before voting day was used to compute a measure of the ‘‘average campaign
day’’ (mean of days remaining for separate ballots or newspapers).
Source independence and inclusiveness. Up to ﬁve sources per article were coded to determine who the ‘‘speakers’’ were, i.e., which categories of individuals or groups were primarily involved in determining the content of an article. Multiple sources were considered; for
example, when a journalist interviews a political leader, two separate sources are coded.
Similarly, up to two sources were coded for each issue statement within an article. We thus
control for the fact that the original issue arguments delivered by a given source are often
embedded in the discourse of a diﬀerent ‘‘speaker’’ through positive or negative references.
For example, it can be the case that all issue statements contained in an article where
7

The 1998 circulation ﬁgures are taken from the WEMF marketing research institute. The two related outlets
‘‘Blick’’ and ‘‘Sonntags-Blick’’ are considered here as one and the same paper. In contrast, the French-speaking
tabloid ‘‘Le Matin’’ was not available in the archive of the Anne´e Politique Suisse, although it is one of the major
Swiss papers. However, a glimpse at the data for ‘‘Blick’’, its counterpart in the German-speaking region, suggests
that tabloids play a relatively minor role in the coverage of referendum campaigns. As a matter of fact, the 28 outlets are edited in 16 diﬀerent Swiss cantons (out of a total of 26 cantons). Further, according to survey data, a
majority of people in all but three cantons (SO, TG, ZH) are ‘‘heavy’’ or ‘‘medium users’’ of at least one newspaper
among those considered here (http://www.remp.ch/fr/glossar/index.php [accessed: 15.02.2010]).
8
The selection was performed by simply picking every fourth article in the database, reinitializing the count for
each ballot issue. Checks were made to ensure that the obtained sample was not diﬀerent from the whole dataset as
concerns provenance, format, and article bias. An issue statement is deﬁned here as an argument or set of arguments related to one speciﬁc matter addressed in the campaign about a ballot measure. It may pertain to a policy
theme (e.g., environment, energy), a driving value or principle (e.g., solidarity), distinctive qualities of the proposed
measure (e.g., ﬂexibility), or the larger context of the ballots (e.g., rationale for a tactic vote). Issue statements have
been classiﬁed into thirty-three categories (full list available upon request from the authors). For reasons of space
limitation, however, we will not dwell on the question of which speciﬁc issues were emphasized in the various referendum campaigns.
9
For various reasons (e.g., missing part), 24 articles could not be coded as to their size and were assigned the median value of all calculated sizes (266 cm2).

Media Coverage of Referendum Campaigns

Lionel Marquis et al.

‘‘journalists’’ are identiﬁed as the speaker category are in fact attributable to other actors to
which journalists refer (e.g., partisan sources, government, and employees’ associations).
Both speakers and issue statements’ sources were coded into fourteen mutually exclusive
categories: (1) parties, politicians, and other party-related groups or individuals; (2) committees; (3) journalists and press agencies; (4) employers’ organizations; (5) employees’
organizations; (6) economic associations; (7) national government; (8) local government; (9)
science- and education-related groups; (10) health-related groups; (11) disabled people’s
groups; (12) women’s and families’ groups; (13) other non-proﬁt organizations; (14) other
actors. Together, categories (1) and (2) represent what we call ‘‘partisan actors’’.10
The importance of journalists (category 3) will be compared with that of the other actor
categories (both as ‘‘speakers’’ and as sources of issue statements) to assess the degree of
the press’ ‘‘source independence’’. Note, however, that the total for any two groups of
actors may exceed 100 percent since, by deﬁnition, several actors may be considered as the
‘‘sources’’ of an article or issue statement.
Further, we used the same source categories to build our measure of inclusiveness. It is
simply the number of discrete categories from which at least one source of issue statements
is drawn. In some of the forthcoming analyses, we will satisfy ourselves with this ﬁrst measure (NBCAT). However, in order to control for the fact that some sources may be only
marginally involved in agenda-building (and inclusiveness may thus be overestimated), we
also assessed the degree of ‘‘equality’’ in the total references to sources of issue statements.
This was achieved through the Index of Qualitative Variation (IQV):


k
P
2
2
k N  fi
IQV ¼

i¼1

N2 ðk  1Þ

;

where k is the total number of source categories, N is the total number of (weighted) issue
statements, and fi is the frequency of all issue statements attributable to source i (N and f
may be computed either as absolute numbers or as proportions). IQV scores can be integrated with NBCAT into a standardized measure of inclusiveness: INC=(NBCAT ⁄ 14) ·
IQV. Somewhat surprisingly, NBCAT and IQV scores are totally uncorrelated at the level of
ballot measures or of separate media outlets (r < .06). In fact, restriction of range in IQV
values (M = 0.87, SD = 0.04, N = 24 ballot measures) explains why NBCAT has a much
greater impact in determining INC scores.11 It also justiﬁes using NBCAT alone, for simpliﬁcation purposes, when IQV scores barely vary in cross-temporal and spatial comparisons.
Substantive coverage. The ‘‘format’’ of each article was coded following a three-fold distinction: (1) ‘‘opinion articles’’ (i.e., editorials, interviews, op-eds, free columns, or letters to
the editor); (2) ‘‘factual articles’’ (i.e., mere reporting); and (3) ‘‘horserace information’’
(i.e., voting cues by parties and groups, opinion polls and other predictions, coverage of
campaign events). The percentage of articles of the ‘‘horserace’’ type is used to assess the
amount of ‘‘non-substantive’’ information. Among ‘‘substantive articles’’, the percentage of
10

Unlike in other policy areas such as foreign policy (see Marquis 2006), virtually all committees on welfare state
issues are backed by parties and politicians.
11
At the level of ballots and papers, INC is strongly associated with NBCAT (r > 0.96) but not with IQV scores
(r < 0.19). This raises the question whether the aggregation rule (unweighted multiplication of the two measures)
is appropriate, since both NBcat and IQV are important on theoretical grounds. At the empirical level, however, it
makes sense not to give more weight to the variable with lesser variation.

‘‘opinion’’ and ‘‘factual’’ articles is used to shed light on the ‘‘orientation’’ and ‘‘information’’ functions of press coverage, respectively.
Bias in coverage. Five broad categories aimed to assess the overall thrust of each article,
based on the general slant of its arguments: (1) predominantly pro (i.e., suggesting a ‘yes’
vote on the ballot question); (2) predominantly con; (3) neutral; (4) mixed, i.e., controversial
and including both sides; and (5) no argument. Similarly, the bias of each issue statement
was coded on the basis of the same categories (excepting the ‘‘no argument’’ category,
which is irrelevant). The categories were collapsed across ballot measures or other relevant
units of analysis (newspapers, language areas, etc.) and combined to produce a summary
indicator of coverage bias:



pro þ neu þ mix
B¼
 0:5  2;
pro þ con þ 2  ðneu þ mixÞ
where pro is the number of positive items, con is the number of negative items, neu is the
number of neutral items, and mix is the number of controversial items.12 Unbiased coverage
is denoted by a B value of 0, while B values of –1 and +1 indicate the highest possible bias
against and in favour of some proposal, respectively.
However, B scores are not well adapted for comparing bias in coverage across several
ballot measures, since the meaning of pros and cons depends on how the ballot question
was framed. One strategy is to rely on absolute values (i.e., |B| scores) to get an estimation
of the overall extent of bias, regardless of direction. Another strategy is to devise a measure
that expresses bias in terms of endorsement or opposition of welfare state policies. This
requires that ‘‘pro’’ and ‘‘con’’ categories be inverted for ballots in the ‘‘retrenchment’’ category, i.e., measures that seek to reduce welfare beneﬁts or to limit welfare expansion. Thus
an original B score of +0.2 remains unchanged for expansion measures but its polarity is
inverted and shifted to –0.2 for retrenchment measures. We call this new measure B*. Computing B* scores also implies that ballot measures can be clearly identiﬁed as ‘‘expansion’’
or ‘‘retrenchment’’ measures. In other words, only media contents that can be clearly
assigned to ‘‘pro-welfare’’ and ‘‘anti-welfare’’ positions should be considered. This leads us
to remove three ‘‘populist’’ proposals (ballots 724, 732, and 781; see Table A1) from the
analysis whenever media bias is analyzed by means of B* scores.13 Except in this case, however, and unless indicated otherwise, all indicators used in this study are based on the total
number of ballots (i.e., 24).

12
We take into account ‘‘neutral’’ and ‘‘mixed’’ items because failing to do so leads to serious distortions in the
cases where coverage is mostly neutral but where only a few biased stories would result in meaninglessly high scores
of coverage bias. Thus, for example, a number of positive items twice larger than that of negative items but equal
to the number of non-valenced (i.e., neutral and controversial) items yields a B of ‘‘only’’ about 0.14. By the same
token, B scores are expected to be more polarized when measured at the level of issue statements rather than at the
level of articles, because in the former case the number of non-valenced items is considerably lower. Note also that
B is very strongly correlated (r > 0.98) with alternative measures of media bias, such as that used by Zaller and
Chiu (1996).
13
For our purposes, we deﬁne populist proposals as emanating from right-wing nationalist parties and groups,
and being opposed by other parties. They consist of ‘‘radical’’, often ‘‘simplistic’’ solutions to welfare problems,
usually charging ‘‘big business’’, high-proﬁt sectors, or available public wealth. However, as these proposals do not
align with the traditional ideological cleavages on welfare issues, opposition to them does not imply an endorsement of the welfare system. Accordingly, these proposals are hardly comparable with other proposals.

Media Coverage of Referendum Campaigns

Lionel Marquis et al.

Spatial homogeneity. Indicators for each of the six above criteria of media fairness can
be compared between the two main cultural areas in order to assess the homogeneity
of media coverage. Simple diﬀerences are calculated between values for the majority
(German-speaking) cultural area and those of minority areas. The only Italian-speaking
paper in our database (i.e., Corriere del Ticino) is considered together with the Frenchspeaking outlets.14
Validity checks. Each of the two independent coders read half the selected articles and
measured all particular aspects listed above. Intercoder disagreement was examined from a
sample of all coded articles and settled through discussion, resulting in more ﬁne-grained
and univocal coding procedures. The issue statements of all the 1088 selected articles were
then coded again. Finally, a sample of 24 articles (one for each proposal) was drawn to
check for coding consistency. Intercoder reliability was found to be satisfactory (Cohen’s
kappa=0.704).15
Weighting procedures. Except for analyses bearing solely on the sheer number of articles,
two weighting procedures were applied. First, in keeping with the literature on public attention and response (e.g., Neuman 1990; Price and Zaller 1993), the size of articles was logged
and used as a weighting factor to account for the notion that marginal returns of an
increase in news volume are generally diminishing. That is, for example, the diﬀerence
between a ﬁve-inch-squared, barely visible, short article and a half-page article is probably
more consequential than the diﬀerence between a full-page and a double-page article.
Second, the ‘‘internal length’’ of issue statements was used to weigh their importance within
our sample.16

4. An overall view of press performance
Table 1 gives an overview of six of the seven criteria of media fairness presented in the theoretical and measurement sections — the ‘‘spatial homogeneity’’ dimension shall be analyzed
separately below.

Intensity of coverage
There is little reason to expect journalists to devote equal attention to all subject matters;
some issues are of greater concern to them (and to their readers) and are thus more likely
to ﬁnd their way onto the media agenda. In fact, there is a good deal of variation in the

14

Journalists and political actors from the two minority cultural areas usually share the same general orientation
toward welfare politics (though not in other important policy ﬁelds) and are probably closer to each other than
they are to journalists and political actors from the German-speaking majority. More importantly, diﬀerences
between majority and all minority areas are more commented upon and likely to be more consequential for
national cohesion than diﬀerences between minorities.
15
This is actually a more than ‘‘fair’’ performance according to the standard interpretation by Landis and Koch
(1977: 165). 67 issue statements were coded by the two coders simultaneously, i.e., an average of 2.8 issues per article. Three issues were coded by only one coder and were removed from the analysis, thus very slightly overestimating intercoder reliability by obfuscating disagreement over the sheer number of issue statements present in a press
article. However, when the three issues are taken into account, the level of disagreement rises by a very small
amount, and j is still 0.67.
16
Five rough categories approximating the ‘‘internal length’’ of issue statements were recoded into ﬁve ratios
reﬂecting their share in the whole article: 0.20, 0.35, 0.50, 0.65, and 0.80.

Media Coverage of Referendum Campaigns

intensity of media coverage of the various ballot issues (SD is about 22 full newspaper
pages for an overall mean of 52 pages). As shown in Table 1, the intensity of press coverage
varies between the speciﬁc policy ﬁelds subsumed under the heading ‘‘welfare state issues’’.
Maternity seems by far the most important category of issues; in contrast, health and disability are of less importance. Further, it seems that retrenchment proposals lead to more
intense campaigns than expansion or populist proposals. This is understandable, since cutting back beneﬁts may lead to more mobilization by target groups than the promise of
developing beneﬁts can possibly achieve. As noted above, though, the two proposals to
introduce a maternity insurance are a notable exception in this regard as they elicited substantial press coverage, probably due to the fact that the constitutional mandate to implement a maternity leave program dated back to the end of World War II and thus the issue
was a recurring one.17 Likewise, referendums are somewhat more covered by the press than
initiatives, probably because they bear more frequently on retrenchment programs, but the
diﬀerence is modest.
In brief, the intensity of press coverage appears to vary between the diﬀerent policy ﬁelds,
arguably as a result of the journalists’ intrinsic interest in them and due to the varying
mobilization of political and civil society actors. But, to a large extent, campaign intensity
is probably also exogenously determined by the uncertainty of the result of the ballot. Both
campaigners and voters are more likely to get involved in referendums when the margin of
victory is perceived to be small (e.g., Downs 1957; Kirchgässner and Schulz 2005). Likewise,
in our dataset the overall intensity of press coverage is substantially correlated with the
closeness of the voting results.18 The closer the (expected) outcome, the more journalists
report on issues.

Source inclusiveness
One indicator of the fairness of the coverage of a ballot issue is how many diﬀerent
political actors are involved in the deliberation process. Our standardized measure of
inclusiveness points to a respectable diversity in the sources of issue statements in press
coverage (overall mean=0.62). It is highest for maternity issues, and lowest for public
health issues, as well as for issues comprised in the ‘‘populist’’ category. We thus assume
that inclusiveness depends on the nature of issues (see Pfetsch 2004: 87–93), as further
suggested by the fact that campaign intensity varies between policy ﬁelds, as we have
seen. Indeed, intensity was shown to depend strongly on inclusiveness, as far as advertisement campaigns are concerned (Marquis and Bergman 2009). Similarly, in press coverage, the correlation between our indicators of intensity and inclusiveness is fairly high
(Pearson’s r = 0.76). In other words, the more political actors enter the ﬁeld (and journalists’ accounts presumably reﬂect this increasing diversity), the more likely the issue at
hand is to receive general attention from the press — whether because inclusiveness
determines intensity or because both coverage features are determined by some higherlevel concept such as ‘‘issue importance’’.

17

Prior to the 1999 and 2004 votes, no less than three proposals to create a maternity insurance had already been
rejected at the polls (Dec. 8, 1974; Dec. 2, 1984; and Dec. 6, 1987).
18
The correlation coeﬃcient is –.54 for the number of articles and –.48 for total surface. Closeness is measured as
the absolute diﬀerence between the actual result and a perfectly balanced result: CLOSENESS = | 50 – RESULT |.

Length of coverage
Campaigns in Swiss direct democracy, whether through paid advertisements or in press
reporting, usually unfold in two phases: there is ﬁrst an accelerating expansion of coverage
and then a sharp decline in the last days before the vote (e.g., Marquis 2006: 429–438;
Tresch 2008: 147–149). Based on all articles published during all 24 campaigns, a thirdorder polynomial function modelling this typical development accounts for 67 percent of
the variance in the total daily surface of articles.19 Hence, at the aggregate level, the twophase pattern ﬁts the data quite well: referendum campaigns on welfare state issues develop
in a typical way, similar to what has been observed for other types of issues.20 In addition,
all policy ﬁelds follow roughly the same pattern — the only notable diﬀerence is that campaigns on health matters (including maternity and disability) reach their peak earlier than
other types of issues.
These ﬁndings may dispel concerns that most media information on ballot issues is
released too fast and too late for citizens to use it eﬃciently in their decision making. But
actually how long is the press coverage of ballot issues? Drawing on our indicator of the
‘‘average campaign day’’, the ‘‘average information’’ is published some 24 days before the
voting date (i.e, it corresponds to the ‘‘mean average day’’ for all 24 ballots). In the same
perspective, the average median day is 21.6; this means that, in a typical campaign, half of
the total (weighted) sum of all information has been released three weeks before voting day,
and the other half is to be released in the remaining weeks. In addition, there appears to be
little diﬀerence between the various ballot issues — even though ballot issues that draw
more intense coverage (pensions, maternity) also tend to be covered for a slightly longer
time. To be sure, actual exposure to the ﬂow of information delivered during referendum
campaigns may greatly vary from one citizen to another, depending for example on which
media outlet (if any) they use for their information (see below). But our ﬁndings are hardly
compatible with the argument that citizens are too time-pressed to make up their minds
and are not given a chance to learn what the ballot issues are all about.

Source independence
The question of media independence and autonomy is important, both from the perspective
of media practices and ethics and for the purposes of deliberative processes. For example,
Tresch (2008: 142–149) shows that ‘‘agenda-building’’ by political actors through press conferences, party meetings, and other public relations activities, constitutes a substantial part
of media content in referendum campaigns. Even though such coverage is certainly not
without merit for citizens’ information and orientation, an overly reliance on external
agenda-building eﬀorts may lead to media instrumentalization beyond that which stems
from patterns of media ownership (see Hallin and Mancini 2004).
19
The following function was ﬁtted to the data: Surface = 0.0015 time3 – 0.1464 time2 + 3.7937 time + 4.3653,
with surface measured as a three-day moving average and time measured as the number of days remaining until
voting day. The proportion of explained variance rises to 80 percent when Sunday editions are removed. Because
of their non-continuous time structure, such editions introduce ‘‘noise’’ into the data. However, only ﬁve outlets
are weekly papers or are published on Sunday, and only 2 percent of articles were published on that weekday.
20
At the level of each single ballot, the characteristic sigmoid shape can be found for all but four campaigns. With
the exception of ballots 572, 622, 781, and 782, all functions have positive values for time3 and time, and negative
values for time2. Article size (rather than number) was used, and time was recoded in eight weekly periods to avoid
high ﬂuctuation in daily values. The average R2 for all 24 campaigns is 0.61 (SD=0.23).

Media Coverage of Referendum Campaigns

Lionel Marquis et al.

If we ﬁrst consider journalists and partisan actors (i.e., parties and committees) in their
role of ‘‘speakers’’ at the level of articles, it comes as no surprise that journalists outweigh
partisan actors (86 percent vs. 17 percent, on average). More remarkably, the diﬀerences
between the various ballot proposals are quite limited. Journalists were identiﬁed as ‘‘speakers’’ in 80 to 88 percent of all articles in each of the six policy ﬁelds, while the corresponding interval is 14 to 21 percent for partisan actors — with the notable exception of labour
market policies, where the parties’ share is only 9 percent.21 As for governmental speakers,
they appear in less than 10 percent of articles in all policy ﬁelds. (Note that the percentages
for the various categories add up to more than 100 percent, since any article can draw on
several types of speakers.)
At the level of issue statements, recall that a total of 2859 issues were coded out of our
sample of 1088 articles. Parties and committees account for about 44 percent of all coded
issue statements, journalists and press agencies for 26 percent, governmental actors for 17
percent, employers’ and employees’ organizations for 14 percent, and other types of actors
for 20 percent (similar to articles, percentages do not add to 100 percent because several
categories of actors can be involved as sources of one issue).22 Overall, then, journalists
appear much less important as a source of issue statements than as a source of articles
(i.e., as ‘‘speakers’’), which makes perfect sense. Conversely, even though partisan actors
are rarely directly involved as speakers (e.g., through interviews or op-eds), they largely
succeed in inﬂuencing campaign news by having their issue statements reported in the press
(Bonfadelli and Blum 2000; Tresch 2008).

Bias in media coverage
The extent of bias in press coverage can also be investigated at two levels: at the level of
whole articles and at the level of issue statements. The analysis draws in both cases on the
classiﬁcation of newspapers’ content into partial (pro or con), neutral, and controversial
categories. The resulting B scores theoretically vary between –1 (all content is against ballot
proposal) and +1 (all content is in favour of proposal). B scores are generally higher for
issues than for articles, because, for one thing, there are far less ‘‘neutral’’ and ‘‘controversial’’ items (about 27 percent) in issue statements than at the level of whole articles (about
68 percent).
A striking feature of our results in Table 1 is the relative neutrality with which Swiss
journalists report on the issues, at least taken collectively — the question of diﬀerences
between media outlets will be addressed below. The mean absolute B value is 0.09 for
articles and 0.18 for issue statements. In fact, a good deal of this ‘‘directional thrust’’
in media reporting is concentrated on ballot issues dealing with health matters (public
health, maternity, disability). For example, the initiatives for ‘‘reduced hospital costs’’
(2000) and ‘‘equal rights for disabled people’’ (2003), as well as the referendum to
oppose paid maternity leaves (2004), stirred up considerable criticism or enthusiasm
from journalists, leading them to take a clear position on these subjects. On closer
21

In this domain, parties are secondary to other representative bodies with which they often have strong ties, in
particular employers’ and employees’ associations (15 percent).
22
These shares expectedly vary across policy ﬁelds. Journalists are most involved in unemployment, public health,
and maternity issues (all 29 percent) and least involved with respect to disability (18 percent). Parties and committees are much quoted sources of statements on pensions and disability (48 and 47 percent) and less so on unemployment and labour regulation (36 percent).

inspection, it appears that the general type of ballot proposals combines with their subject matter. As a category, the three populist proposals of the years 2000–2002 (including hospital costs) were treated in a far less even-handed manner than retrenchment or
expansion proposals, especially as concerns bias in issue statements.23 We may summarize these ﬁndings by saying that journalists, most of the time, report about ballot
issues in a quite balanced way.
Interestingly, bias in press coverage is substantially related to several other features examined here (correlations of 0.4 or higher). To begin with, article bias decreases as coverage
intensity and inclusiveness increase. In other words, imbalance in coverage looms large
when journalists have little to report and rely on fewer sources. At the level of issue statements, a crucial link seems to be with the importance of partisan actors as sources of statements: the more parties and committees are referred to as a basis for issue analysis, the
lesser the bias.
Using B* values we can also determine how media coverage is basically oriented
toward welfare state schemes (i.e., the extent to which campaign news systematically
supports welfare state expansion ⁄ protection rather than welfare state limitation ⁄
retrenchment). In so doing, we obtain a mean B* value of 0.01 for articles and 0.06
for issues — the press thus displays a very slight pro-welfare bias. This strongly suggests that there is no overall systematic pro-welfare or anti-welfare bias in press coverage. However, diﬀerences exist between the various policy ﬁelds. While neutral with
respect to pensions, labour market and unemployment, Swiss media outlets as a whole
seem committed to more generous social protection programmes in the area of public
health (B*=0.19 for issue statements), including maternity and invalidity (B*=0.35 and
0.31, respectively).
It should also be noted that editorials and interviews are more critical of the welfare state
than other format types. B* scores (issue statements) for editorials and interviews are about
–0.2 and –0.1, respectively, as compared to +0.1 or higher for reports, letters to the editor,
and campaign news. Journalists opposed to welfare policies, it would seem, rely heavily on
writing editorials and selecting anti-welfare interviewees. But this does not suﬃce to countervail the bulk of pro-welfare coverage that stems from ‘‘factual reporting’’ or coverage of
campaign events. Besides, the general thrust of media coverage is highly dependent on
which types of actors get their messages across in the various newspapers, since more often
than not journalists are balanced in their own issue statements (B* = –0.02). For instance,
in the many cases where the parties’ issues ﬁnd their way into the media, center-left parties
are much more likely to voice pro-welfare issues than are right parties (B* = 0.42 vs.
–0.26). Similarly, the bias brought about by employees’ organizations counterbalances that
of employers’ organizations (B* = 0.35 vs. –0.29). Overall, referendum committees are relatively neutral toward the welfare system (B* = 0.04), but the organizations representing
speciﬁc population groups (retired people, disabled people, youth, women, families) are
overwhelmingly pro-welfare. Interestingly, the bias exhibited by governmental sources is
quite diﬀerent depending on the level of government. Institutions and civil servants at the
national level (e.g., federal councillors, senior oﬃcials) are clearly less supportive of the

23

The 2000 and 2001 initiatives (‘‘reduced hospital costs’’ and ‘‘cheaper drugs’’) were fought by all parties, while
the 2002 initiative (‘‘gold reserves to retirement pensions’’) was launched by the Swiss People’s Party and backed
by other smaller populist right parties. Accordingly, the latter was supported by an important minority of 46% of
the popular votes, compared to 18% and 31% for the two earlier initiatives.

welfare system (or, at least, of welfare state expansion) than are their counterparts at the
cantonal or local level (B* = –0.15 vs. 0.48).24

Substantive coverage
We focus here on the three main formats of campaign coverage (i.e., ‘‘opinion articles’’,
‘‘factual reporting’’, and ‘‘horserace information’’) to determine how ‘‘substantive’’ campaign coverage is. Concerns are often expressed that media news that unduly revolves
around the horserace and ‘‘game’’ aspects of campaigns has a deleterious inﬂuence on public deliberation and citizens’ decision-making. In fact, horserace information was present in
all campaigns but it is quite weak (14 percent of the overall amount of news, on average)
compared to ‘‘opinion articles’’ (35 percent) and ‘‘factual articles’’ (51 percent). Horserace
coverage varies between a minimum of 5 percent for unemployment ballot issues and a
maximum of 20 percent for labour regulation ballot issues. In comparison, the share of
opinion articles varies between 29 and 37 percent depending on policy domains, while the
share of factual articles varies between 47 and 58 percent. Thus, unlike in other contexts,
the horserace is clearly not the leading theme in Swiss referendum campaigns.25

5. A dynamic view of independence, inclusiveness, bias, and substance
The picture thus far supports the notion of rather ‘‘fair’’ journalistic practices, as media
coverage appears to be relatively balanced, autonomous and substantive. We now examine
the hypothesis that journalists are however not immune to the pressure of the political environment and that they become increasingly dependent on external and ⁄ or biased sources of
information over the course of campaigns. In other words, we ask whether the ‘‘fairness’’ of
campaign coverage is aﬀected by agenda-building eﬀorts of political actors. We thus investigate the dynamics of campaign coverage, focusing on four aspects examined above: source
independence and inclusiveness, bias in coverage and substantive coverage. We believe that
the time dimension can add to our understanding of how much journalistic output is autonomous, inclusive, unbiased, and substantive — and possibly also why it deviates from such
norms.
Beginning with source independence, one interesting result is that journalists are the only
actor category whose importance as a source of issue statements increases throughout the
24

This diﬀerence is consistent across all types of issues, excepting maternity, and it may be explained in two ways.
On the one hand, the Swiss federal political system is largely based on the ‘‘principle of subsidiarity’’, which posits
that the federal state should assume only those tasks which cannot be performed eﬀectively at a more local level.
However, the federal state assumes the greatest responsibility for managing social beneﬁts and ﬁnancing pension
and health insurances, while local governments may feel less under pressure. In addition, cantons and municipalities have to draw on their own resources to provide social assistance to needy people who fall through the cracks
of the social safety net and are no longer eligible for national welfare beneﬁts. Accordingly, local authorities are
less likely to endorse cutbacks in social beneﬁts and are more inclined to support their constituencies’ demands for
social services. On the other hand, the principle of collegiality implies that federal councillors from left parties are
compelled to advocate the view of the government as a collective body even when it contradicts the position of
their party or their own opinion. For example, Federal Councillor Ruth Dreifuss, member of the Social Democratic Party and head of the Federal Department of Home Aﬀairs (1994–2002), often had to oppose initiatives
from left groups aiming at expanding or introducing new welfare programmes.
25
This is all the more signiﬁcant as the deﬁnition of horserace information used in this study is rather broad. As a
matter of fact, voting cues by parties and major organizations account for the bulk of ‘‘horserace information’’ as
operationalized here — rather than opinion surveys or descriptions of campaign events.

whole campaign period, even though their share as ‘‘speakers’’ actually declines (see Figure 1). In contrast, parties and committees become a bit less marginal as speakers (gaining
on average some 10 percent of the total share in the last seven weeks). But, most notably,
partisan actors remain a major source of issue statements for press journalists during the
whole campaign period; their share varies between 33 and 61 percent, but without clear
upward or downward trend over time.26 Just as signiﬁcant, however, is the fact that the
sheer number of actor categories used as sources of issue statements grows almost linearly
during the campaign period — except in the very last weeks — and actually almost doubles
(from 3 to 6) in the ﬁrst six weeks (see again Figure 1, right-hand axis). To use our terminology, this shows that press coverage becomes more inclusive as time goes by.27 For example, actors that may be regarded as ‘‘outsiders’’ (science and health professionals,
associations defending the rights of women ⁄ families ⁄ disabled people, non-proﬁt organizations, and other similar actors) rise from an average number of 0.7 (8th week before vote) to
an average of 1.5 (4th week) and manage to keep their share of issue statements at just
under 20 percent throughout the campaign.
Taken together, these results suggest that the dynamics of campaign coverage on welfare
state issues is hardly compatible with a radical understanding of the ‘‘determination theory’’. Our analysis reveals that journalists maintain their control over the newsgathering
process and that no single source of campaign issue statements holds sway. As Figure 2
shows, however, this does not mean that journalists downplay the inﬂuence of political
actors — or even try to do so in a collective sense. In fact, press coverage increasingly takes
the form of ‘‘opinion articles’’ over time, while the share of ‘‘factual reporting’’ sharply
declines. In the eight-week period, opinion articles become at least twice more frequent in
relative terms (from 22 to 52 percent), while the share of factual articles considerably
decreases (from 69 to 26 percent). With two exceptions, all campaigns exhibit this pattern,
26
The same holds, albeit to a smaller extent, for governmental actors, who account for over one quarter of all
issue statements in the ﬁrst four campaign weeks, but whose importance then declines to less than 15 percent. Yet,
as compared to their tiny share of 5 percent of articles as ‘‘speakers’’, governmental actors do succeed in getting
their issues on the campaign agenda, especially at the earlier stage.
27
For the sake of simplicity, Figure 1 displays only the number of issue source categories, because IQV values
hardly vary (min: 0.85, max: 0.90) and thus the variations over time of the composite index INC boil down to variations in the number of source categories.

whereby opinions gain prominence at the expense of the presentation of facts as voting day
draws nearer. This may be related to another ﬁnding stressed above, namely that ‘‘speakers’’, i.e. those actors accountable for the content of an article, comprise less journalists and
more partisan actors as time goes by. As for horserace news, its salience ﬂuctuates within a
narrow 9–16 percent range –– with the understandable exception of the last campaign week,
given the close proximity of the vote and mobilization eﬀorts by parties and other groups.28
In sum, there does not seem to be a strong focus or even focalization on the horserace during referendum campaigns in Switzerland. To a large extent, the overall evolution in the format of information is understandable, and some observers may ﬁnd it comforting from a
normative perspective. It can be argued that, as a collective actor, journalists ﬁrst proceed
to present the facts and main arguments (i.e., information function) and then provide citizens with particular opinions to help them take position on the issues (i.e., orientation function).
Likewise, the ‘‘tone’’ of media coverage changes over time. To begin with, articles become
more ‘‘partial’’, i.e., they increasingly take sides for or against the various ballot proposals
(see Figure 3). The share of partial articles amounts to slightly more than 20 percent in the
ﬁrst three weeks and approaches 50 percent by the last two weeks.29 In contrast, the share
of partial issue statements — even though much higher than that of articles in overall level
— slightly decreases over time. To a large extent this stems from the fact that issue statements get more ‘‘controversial’’ (rather than more ‘‘neutral’’) as voting day draws closer,
and this is probably reﬂective of the growing recognition by journalists of the complexity of
ballot issues. That the press becomes more committed to its opinion-giving and orientation
function in the later stages of campaigns does not entail, however, that it provides an
increasingly biased picture of the ballot issues. As shown in Figure 3 (right-hand axis), it is
striking how little deviation there is from perfect neutrality (i.e., B*=0) throughout the
eight campaign weeks, based either on articles or on separate issue statements. In fact, 87
percent of the weekly bias scores for articles are comprised in a range of ± 20 percent
28
We may also add that most newspapers publish a summary list of all parties’ and important organizations’ voting cues in the last week before voting day (which we also included in the horserace category).
29
One natural hypothesis is that journalists themselves become less impartial over time. There is strong evidence
supporting this assumption, as the share of partial items among journalists’ articles rises from a low 16 percent
seven weeks before voting day to a full 44 percent in the last campaign week.

around the neutral value.30 In sum, the fact that campaigns become more partisan over time
does not necessarily imply that one side comes to prevail over the other. More often than
not media campaign coverage remains remarkably balanced until the end. As we have
shown above, ballot campaigns usually heat up in the ﬁnal weeks, as agenda-building
eﬀorts by partisan groups intensify. But even then there is very little to suggest that the
press gives in to external pressure and leaves the ‘‘undecided’’ citizens or ‘‘late deciders’’
exposed to the unchecked inﬂuence of partisan or special interests.

6. A particularistic view of media fairness
Based on a number of formal criteria, the press coverage of ballot issues on welfare state
issues appears relatively ‘‘fair’’. However, such evidence may be somehow illusory if it stems
from the aggregation of contradictory patterns from diﬀerent types of media outlets. For
example, a balanced, unbiased portray of ballot issues at the aggregate level may conceal
much greater variation between individual papers, some of which may be slanted toward
welfare state expansion while others may be committed to welfare retrenchment. As most
citizens read only one newspaper on a regular basis, this would mean that a majority of
potential voters are exposed to a one-sided communication ﬂow. In addition, if the papers
on one side of the fence (e.g., the ‘‘pro-welfare camp’’) have a larger overall readership than
those on the other side, then the societal balance of information would no longer be guaranteed, despite indications to the contrary such as those provided in the preceding sections.
To investigate this question, we ask how the coverage of welfare state issues compares
across media outlets. Table 2 displays the whole range of indicators used thus far and shows
how they vary between the 28 media outlets included in this analysis.
30
The same result is obtained if one takes absolute B scores (and hence all 24 campaigns are considered). However, when issue statements are considered instead of articles, the proportion of biased weekly values (|B|>0.2) rises
to 52 percent. To some extent this stems from our sampling procedure, because many weekly values are derived
from a limited number of cases — while the whole data is used for articles’ bias. Accordingly, compared to statistics based on exhaustive data, there is a heightened probability that more extreme values of issue bias are produced
by chance alone. Moreover, these frequent deviations from neutrality are in general temporary and unlikely to last
for longer than one week. In fact, the percent of adjacent weeks that exhibit a similar biased value (e.g., B scores
greater than 0.2 for both weeks) is only 19 percent.

We will focus here on the three aspects of independence, bias, and substance. An inspection of individual values and standard deviations shows that there is indeed some variation
between newspapers on these three criteria, but that it is rather limited. According to our
bias measure B* for articles, the economy-oriented newspapers NZZ and Journal de Gene`ve
may qualify as ‘‘anti-welfare’’, as they were, on average, predominantly lopsided against
welfare state preservation ⁄ extension. In contrast, the left-wing paper Quotidien Jurassien
appears as ‘‘pro-welfare’’.31 At the level of issue statements, there is greater variation in B*
scores, but few papers stand outside a ± 20 percent range around the neutral value (antiwelfare: NZZ; pro-welfare: Quotidien Jurassien and Tribune de Gene`ve). In addition, few
single ballots gave way to skewed information even in any separate outlet. Of all instances
with a suﬃcient number of cases, 11 percent were rather pro-welfare and 8 percent were
rather anti-welfare.32 Weekly (mostly Sunday) papers represent an exception to this overall
moderation in dealing with welfare issues, as they appear slanted toward pro-welfare positions (but self-evidently not the right-wing Weltwoche). In sum, the concern that our ﬁnding
of balanced coverage might be an artifact of aggregation is not substantiated by our data.
Our ﬁndings concerning the criteria of source independence and substantive coverage tell
a similar story. Signiﬁcant variation between media outlets is scarce, even though some
peculiarities are worth pointing out. For example, journalists outweigh partisan sources in
the Tages-Anzeiger, while in other outlets (e.g., Quotidien Jurassien) these two categories are
almost equally present — as speakers or sources of issue statements. In general, journalists
play a larger role in national papers than in regional and cantonal papers, which may have
to do with the resources media organizations must invest to have their journalists closely
cover ballot campaigns. Finally, the ‘‘format’’ of articles shows little diﬀerence between
newspapers. Some of them are more preoccupied with opinion formation than with factual
reporting (NZZ, Nouvelliste, Quotidien Jurassien, Schaﬀhauser Nachrichten), while the
opposite holds especially for a couple of French-speaking papers (La Liberte´, Tribune de
Gene`ve, L’Express). With one single exception, horserace information account for less than
20 percent of campaign coverage in all papers. In any account, then, the overall variation in
source independence and information format is limited. The existence of such variation cannot be taken to mean that the press coverage of ballot campaigns in Switzerland is a
mere collection of disjoint ‘‘speciﬁc campaigns’’ with potentially divergent consequences for
diﬀerent segments of the electorate.

7. Spatial patterns of media coverage
We now turn to the issue of spatial homogeneity. Provided that the Swiss media system is
highly fragmented along linguistic lines, is this segmentation reﬂected in region-speciﬁc
‘‘styles’’ of media coverage? More speciﬁcally, to what extent are the particular dimensions
of media coverage that we analyzed thus far similar in the two main Swiss regions? As

31
In the following, we will not comment on results for newspapers with a small number of published articles
(N < 50). Note that the indicators in this section are computed on the basis of all articles published in each newspaper, without distinction of the speciﬁc ballot measures.
32
292 campaigns in individual papers were analyzed and B* scores for articles were computed for each of them.
Only cases where a newspaper published more than 4 articles on a given campaign were considered. When the same
procedure is applied to B* scores for issue statements, the proportion of seemingly ‘‘biased campaigns’’ is much
higher, but also less reliable (see above note 30).

becomes clear from Table 3, diﬀerences are in general rather limited, and sizable diﬀerences
are only found for particular types of ballot issues.
Campaign intensity as reported in Table 3 is a composite measure derived from the surface of articles, from the circulation ﬁgures of the newspapers, and from the number of people eligible to vote.33 The measure thus points out diﬀerences in the overall potential
exposure of individual citizens and shows that campaigns are clearly more intense in the
German-speaking region. The diﬀerence is particularly noticeable and systematic with
respect to pension and maternity issues. As concerns campaign length, the ‘‘average campaign day’’ indicator suggests that overall diﬀerences are slight. Campaigns may last a bit
longer in the German-speaking press, but mainly for measures pertaining to unemployment,
and in any case not for measures on disability. Further, as would be expected from these
diﬀerences in intensity and length, media campaigns are also somewhat more ‘‘inclusive’’ in
the German-speaking press, where, on average, two additional actor categories are used as
sources of issue statements.
Turning to coverage bias, we again note that diﬀerences between the regions are marginal.
However, as already pointed out above, bias is more conspicuous when measured at the level
of issue statements rather than at the level of whole articles. Although the overall diﬀerence
is negligible, this stems from the fact that the small diﬀerences that do exist cancel each other
out across the various policy ﬁelds. Thus coverage in the German-speaking press was more
skewed on health and disability measures, while it was less skewed on maternity issues (most
notably, French- and Italian-speaking papers had been much more enthusiastically endorsing the 1999 maternity leave project than had their German-speaking counterparts).
Next, we compared the independence of journalists from external sources of information
in the two regions. On the whole, the diﬀerences are modest. As speakers, German-speaking
journalists were less prominent than journalists from other regions on maternity and disability issues, but they were more ‘‘autonomous’’ on unemployment. Diﬀerences were somewhat more pronounced as regards the source of issue statements. Journalists were more
likely to be the source of reported issues in the German-speaking press than in the Frenchand Italian-speaking press, especially for unemployment and labour regulation (but not for
maternity and disability issues). For example, French-speaking journalists sometimes draw
on scientiﬁc or educational sources (8 percent) for addressing labour and unemployment
issues, while their German-speaking colleagues never do so (at least in our sample). These
regional patterns may have at least two diﬀerent causes. On the one hand, turning to external sources may occur because journalists are less sure where they stand (or should stand)
on the issues and ⁄ or because they believe that public opinion on the issues is not crystallized
yet and need orientating information from political sources. On the other hand, the
observed regional gaps may simply be reﬂective of more routinized relationships between
journalists and political actors in some policy domains.
The ‘‘format’’ of information was then considered, with a focus on horserace information. Marginal regional gaps were observed, as the share of horserace items rarely exceeded
20 percent in any region, but the diﬀerences were rather systematic. In general, information
in German-speaking papers is more often of the ‘‘horserace’’ type than in French- or
Italian-speaking papers (an overall 4 percent gap), and this diﬀerence holds for 17 of 24
33

Le Nouveau Quotidien, DAZ, and Berner Tagwacht are not taken into account in this analysis, due to unavailable circulation ﬁgures, but they represent only about 2 percent of articles and surface. More consequential is the
fact that the French-speaking tabloid Le Matin, which has the largest circulation in the western region, is not
included in our data. The absence of this paper probably explains part of the diﬀerence between the two regions.

ballot proposals. The largest between-region diﬀerences in the share of horserace articles
are found for pension and health issues, but there was actually more horserace coverage in
the French ⁄ Italian-speaking area on maternity and disability issues.34

8. Conclusion
The aim of this study was to assess the fairness of the press coverage of referendums on
welfare state issues in Switzerland. We distinguished seven dimensions of media coverage in
order to determine how it compares to idealized notions of the media’s role in the democratic process. In this concluding section we summarize our analysis of media coverage
quality and, whenever possible and sensible, we relate our results to those of other studies.
First, as regards the intensity of press coverage in daily newspapers, we found about eight
articles per proposal and newspaper, amounting to two or three full pages of coverage.
With only modest variation across votes (though variation is more pronounced across
media outlets), such coverage might be considered as a ‘‘fair’’ performance.35
Second, turning to the question of campaign duration, our results show that the press coverage peaked two to three weeks before the voting day, and that half of the total information had been released some 22 days before the poll. Although comparable studies of
European referendums are lacking (see Novik 2009: 13) we interpret this average duration
as ‘‘appropriate’’, since press coverage was relatively gradual and did not surge in the last
campaign days.
Third, we investigated the bias in media coverage. Overall, we ﬁnd a minimal to nonexistent bias at the level of press articles (i.e., the general thrust of news stories) toward prowelfare state orientation. When looking at particular issue statements, the bias appeared
larger but still not overwhelming. In fact, bias was largely restricted to matters of public
health in the larger sense (hospital costs, price of drugs, maternity, disability, etc.) and was
virtually absent from campaigns on such themes as pensions, labour regulation, and unemployment. The variation in balance among diﬀerent newspaper outlets is rather limited.
Concerning articles in daily newspapers, only the Journal de Gene`ve and the NZZ adopted
a rather ‘‘anti-welfare’’ position while the Quotidien Jurassien was lopsided toward the
‘‘pro-welfare’’ camp. However, compared to news balance in other referendum campaigns,
such as Pilon’s (2009) report on the Ontario Provincial Referendum and Hobolt’s (2009:
186–189) analysis of the ﬁrst Irish referendum on the Nice Treaty, we conclude that the
reporting on welfare state issues in the Swiss print media generally provides little ammunition to those who suspect or condemn a systematic bias in media coverage.

34
It may be that, due to a more skeptical opinion climate toward the latter issues in their region, German-speaking
journalists had more incentives to engage in opinion formation rather than stick to hard facts and descriptions of
the situation. This is especially true for maternity issues, as welfare state support is 30 percent higher on average
among French- and Italian-speaking voters than among German-speaking voters (our own calculations from the
municipality-level data available in the ‘‘Political Atlas of Switzerland’’, Swiss Federal Statistical Oﬃce).
35
This rather lenient judgment may be qualiﬁed by comparing our results with those of Hobolt (2009: 207)208),
who found more intense press coverage for the 2005 French and the Dutch referendum campaigns on the European
Constitution, even if we restrict the analysis to the country’s two major broadsheet newspapers (NZZ and
Le Temps, in the Swiss case) as Hobolt did. However, the ﬁgures might not be fully comparable; the vote on the
European Constitution might have been of greater salience than single welfare state proposals. Moreover, the lower
frequency of popular votes in France and the Netherlands as compared to Switzerland may explain a more intense
coverage of those (rare) referendums. We should therefore await further research on news reporting in the Swiss
context in order to compare our ﬁndings.

Media Coverage of Referendum Campaigns

Lionel Marquis et al.

Fourth, the relative independence of journalists from external (particularly partisan)
sources was examined. Similar to coverage bias, the dimension of media autonomy was
investigated at two levels: articles and issue statements. At the level of articles, it was found
that journalists are by far the most important ‘‘speakers’’. Although they can delegate their
agenda-setting role to other actors by soliciting their opinions through interviews, op-eds,
or free columns, they rarely do so — at least not until the last three or four campaign
weeks. Hence, our analysis suggests that the Swiss newspapers’ progressive loss of attachment to parties and other political groups (Meier and Schanne 1994) may have enhanced
their ‘‘autonomy’’ — a concept not to be confused with that of journalistic ‘‘objectivity’’,
which is outside the scope of this study. However, when evaluated at the level of issue
statements, the press coverage of referendum campaigns appears in a somewhat diﬀerent
light. Without there being anything ‘‘unfair’’ on a priori grounds, media coverage appears
to largely reﬂect the issue agenda of the major political forces involved in campaigns (i.e.,
political parties and committees, governmental agencies, professional associations, etc.).
Altogether, these non-media sources account for about three times the number of journalistic issue items.36 In our view, there is no basic contradiction between the ﬁndings from these
distinct levels of analysis; taken together, they are reﬂective of both main functions traditionally assigned to news media — an information and an orientation function.
The dominance of journalists as sources of articles suggests that press journalists function
as gatekeepers, selecting who may intervene directly in the news process, rather than as
mere providers of a ‘‘free forum’’ to which any group or individual is granted equal and
unlimited access. On the other hand, the press coverage of ballot issues is of course reﬂective — and possibly ‘‘reﬂexive’’ in the Luhmannian sense (Neidhardt 1994) — of what the
main political actors have to say. Therefore, media agenda-setting is not exogenous, but largely driven by the agenda of various political elites. As our measure of source inclusiveness
suggests, Swiss press journalists tend to rely on a broad array of diﬀerent actor categories,
and media coverage may thus be said to be ‘‘inclusive’’. However, this substantial diversity
in news coverage does not allow us to rule out the gatekeeping hypothesis: it is questionable
whether all actors who wanted to participate in the campaign debates ﬁnally found their
way in news reporting.
Next, our data provided insight into the substance of media coverage. We found that the
often-criticized ‘‘horserace’’ nature of election coverage is not prevalent in the context of
Swiss referendum campaigns. For one thing, horserace information accounts for only about
13 percent of all news items — a tiny proportion compared, for instance, with U.S. presidential campaigns (Strömbäck and Dimitrova 2006), the 1995 Quebec secession referendum
(see Pilon 2009), or even with more readily comparable campaigns such as the 2000 Danish
referendum on the adoption of the Euro (De Vreese and Semetko 2002). In addition,
although the number of ‘‘factual information’’ items exceeds that of ‘‘opinion’’ items, both
are important categories of press coverage. This again suggests that information and orientation are important functions performed by the media, and that in assuming these functions the media go well beyond predicting which side is likely to win.
Lastly, spatial homogeneity was deﬁned as an additional norm of media coverage. This
norm is rooted in the perception that public opinion on welfare state issues frequently
diverges across the main linguistic areas. Accordingly, distinctive media coverage threatens
to reinforce the pre-existing cleavages and to undermine national cohesion by promoting a
36

As compared to Tresch’s (2008: 142–149) ﬁndings on media coverage of European politics, state actors play a
slightly less prominent role in debates on welfare state issues.

‘‘tyranny of the majority’’. It was found that regional gaps in the press coverage of campaigns were minimal and largely restricted to three criteria: intensity of coverage, horserace
reporting and source independence. In the German-speaking region, campaigns were somewhat more intense, more inclined toward horserace information, and journalists were more
often the source of issues than was the case in the other linguistic areas. This may reﬂect
either economic or cultural diﬀerences of media organizations between the regions. But
again, the hallmark of this analysis is similarity rather than discrepancy. Even when looking
at speciﬁc welfare policy areas (pensions, health, etc.), press coverage appears — with few
exceptions — strikingly similar across both regions, in line with the more detailed analysis
of Swiss European policy by Tresch (2008).
In conclusion, the coverage of referendum campaigns on welfare state issues by the Swiss
press appears reasonably fair when examined from a broad perspective. However, this
appraisal of ‘‘satisfactory’’ (though certainly not ‘‘optimal’’) media campaign coverage is
based on quantitative indicators that may fail to capture many intrinsic qualities of media
coverage. Admittedly, the standards used to assess the fairness of media coverage were not
excessively high, and the conclusions we draw from our analysis await conﬁrmation from
independent datasets and studies, in particular from more qualitative-oriented research
‘‘putting qualitative ﬂesh on quantitative bones’’ (Tarrow 2004: 176). Accordingly, we call
for further testing of the normative framework developed in the present study and for replications of our analysis in other settings. In addition, there is clearly a need of going beyond
the mere ‘‘procedural’’ approach to fairness developed here. Although they can be estimated by quantitative indicators, procedure-independent criteria of media fairness may be
best deﬁned through qualitative methods.
