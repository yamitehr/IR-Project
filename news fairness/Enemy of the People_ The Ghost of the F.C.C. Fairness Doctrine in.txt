Enemy of the People: The Ghost of the
F.C.C. Fairness Doctrine in the Age of
Alternative Facts
by Ian Klein1
“If you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes the truth.”
-Joseph Goebbels2

Abstract
The FCC Fairness Doctrine required that all major broadcasting outlets
spend equal time covering both sides of all controversial issues of national
importance. The Fairness Doctrine remained the standard for decades before
it stopped being enforced during the Reagan administration, and was
removed from the Federal Register during the Obama administration. Since
the Fairness Doctrine’s disappearance, the perception by conservatives and
progressives alike has been that major media outlets display overt biases
towards one political affiliation or the other. As it becomes harder to
determine real news from “fake news,” Americans’ trust in media is at an
all-time low. An appreciable number of people of various political
affiliations now want the Fairness Doctrine to be reintroduced in some form.
The purpose of this article is threefold: first, to examine the modern
analogues to legal and Constitutional issues that the Fairness Doctrine
overcame in its infancy, as Section II explains. Second, to explore modern
problems vis-à-vis media distrust, bias, and reliability, as Section III
discusses. Third, to explain why a “Fairness Doctrine 2.0” would go a long
way towards curbing the biases in broadcast news media and restoring the
American public’s trust in journalism, outlined in Section IV. Finally,
Section V will offer alternative solutions to the modern issues of media bias,
public distrust of media, and “fake news.”

Introduction
The Digital Age has seen mankind develop abilities that our forefathers
would find indistinguishable from magic: we have created glass rectangles
that, if touched in the right spots, will make pizza appear at our doors; we
have engineered programs that effortlessly navigate a 600-ton flying
machine from one part of the planet to another;3 perhaps most impressively,
we have amassed archives containing several lifetimes worth of every flavor
of pornography imaginable.4 Arguably the most powerful of these abilities,
however, is the ability to instantaneously disseminate information—
including misleading information—to a potentially unlimited number of
people.
Humans have more access to information than ever before. The
problem that such access creates, however, is that this information—
including information relating to significant, controversial issues—is
frequently presented in a very biased manner.5 An overwhelming majority
of Americans believe that major media outlets are objectively biased, taking
either an overtly liberal or overtly conservative position on major issues.6
This distrust of media reached a boiling point during and after the 2016
Presidential Election, with both President Donald J. Trump and thencandidate Hillary Clinton decrying various mainstream media outlets as
“fake news” responsible for the widespread dissemination of “alternative
facts.”7 While much of the fake news epidemic can be attributed to openly

partisan sources such as Infowars and Occupy Democrats, the public
perception of major media outlets—such as MSNBC, CNN, and Fox
News—has gone from bad to worse; almost three quarters of Americans now
not only believe that mainstream media displays overt biases, but reports
information that the outlets know to be false or purposefully misleading—in
other words, fake news.8 This perception of willful bias is pervasive, not
only among the general public, but in our political leaders as well. President
Obama decried the conservative Fox News as “destructive,” while in 2017,
President Trump described what he called the “fake news” media as “the
Enemy of the American people.”9
An electorate that overwhelmingly distrusts the media creates two
problems: (1) an uninformed electorate which casts votes based on
incomplete, biased, or fraudulent fact reporting, and (2) an increasinglypolarized population, whose pre-existing biases and political animosities are
exacerbated by the consumption of factually-irreconcilable accounts of
national and global affairs.10
A potential solution to the epidemic of media bias and distrust would
be to re-implement the FCC Fairness Doctrine. The Fairness Doctrine
required that holders of broadcast licenses devote a reasonable amount of
their airtime to “controversial issues of public importance,” and that when
such issues were presented, contrasting views on the issues had to be aired.11
Re-implementing the Fairness Doctrine or implementing a similar rule
would likely reduce the amount of overt bias in media—or at least the public
perception of media bias, and resulting distrust of media—and foster a betterinformed American people.
This article will examine the potential reimplementation of the FCC
Fairness Doctrine (“Fairness Doctrine 2.0”) in response to the contemporary

Fairness Doctrine. Part III gives a detailed account of contemporary issues
surrounding media bias and “fake news.” Part IV discusses the potential
benefits and consequences of Fairness Doctrine 2.0, including the modern
analogues to the legal dilemmas that the Fairness Doctrine created and
overcame. Part V discusses several alternative methods of restoring the
public’s trust in media. Ultimately, this article will discuss why
implementing Fairness Doctrine 2.0 would go a long way towards curbing
bias in broadcast news media, and likely restore some of the public’s trust in
journalism.
Finally, the irony is not lost on me that, in writing an article about the
biases of various news outlets, I cite to sources published by many of those
very same outlets. To that end, I quote the first anonymous muse to utter
these words into the vast, endless reaches of cyberspace: “[i]t really do be
like that sometimes.”12

History of the Fairness Doctrine
Since the outset of broadcast regulation and jurisprudence, courts
justified the regulation of broadcasters because of two overarching themes:
the scarcity of broadcast frequencies and the right of the public to be
informed.13
Early Regulation of Mass Communication
After World War I, and its contemporaneous technological advances,
radio became the most efficient form of mass communication available to
mankind. Accordingly, the United States passed the Radio Act of 1927
which, in addition to regulating radio in general, laid the groundwork for the
Fairness Doctrine by (1) requiring licenses for radio broadcasters, and (2)
mandating that the licensees “serve the public interest.”14
During the Roosevelt Administration, Congress passed the Federal
Communications Act of 1934, which supplanted the Radio Act and created
the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”): the chief regulatory
body governing radio (and later, communications generally), with a mission
to “encourage the larger and more effective use of radio in the public
interest.”15 While officially replacing the Radio Act, it is important to note

that the Communications Act retained the Radio Act’s requirements of
licensure and “serving the public interest.”16 The FCC’s initial purpose was
not censorship and regulation of what media outlets could publish or
broadcast, but to issue and renew broadcast licenses.17 The FCC believed
that broadcasters had a duty to the public because of their position as
gatekeepers of the news, that a democratic society should be given maximum
opportunity to express diverse viewpoints on controversial issues, and,
importantly, maximum opportunity to hear and read the conflicting view of
others.18
In addition to creating the FCC, the Communications Act established
public ownership of all broadcast channels—that is, broadcast channels
belonged to the state as a representative body of the people.19
The FCC lived a relatively peaceful existence until 1938 when, like so
many facets of American life before and since,20 that peace was disrupted by
Bostonians: namely Lawrence J. Flynn and John Shepard III.21 Flynn, a
former employee of the Yankee Network (an ironically-named Boston-based
radio news network that existed from 1929-1964), challenged the licenses of
two Yankee Network affiliate stations that Shepard owned—WNAC and
WAAB—claiming that the stations were being used to air one-sided political
viewpoints, and broadcast attacks (including editorials) against local and
federal politicians that Shepard opposed.22
The FCC requested that Shepard provide details about these programs,
and in response, the Yankee Network agreed to drop the editorials.23 Flynn
then created a company called Mayflower Broadcasting, and petitioned the
FCC to award him WAAB’s license.24 The FCC refused Mayflower’s
request to take over Yankee Network’s WAAB license because of Flynn’s
difficulty in obtaining adequate financing for his proposed outlet.25 The FCC
reluctantly renewed WAAB’s license, and in so doing, laid the groundwork
for the Fairness Doctrine.26
The FCC took issue with Shepard’s one-sided editorials that, in the
FCC’s words, “made no pretense at objective, impartial reporting . . .

[revealing] a serious misconception of [WAAB’s] duties and functions under
the law.”27 The FCC explained that a “truly free radio” could not be used
solely to advocate causes, political candidacies, and principles which the
licensee regarded favorably.28 “In brief,” the FCC explained, “[t]he
broadcaster cannot be an advocate.”29 Importantly, the FCC laid out its
policy considerations for condemning WAAB’s one-sided editorials:
Freedom of speech on the radio must be broad enough to provide
full and equal opportunity for the presentation to the public of all
sides of public issues. Indeed, as one licensed to operate in a
public domain the licensee has assumed the obligation of
presenting all sides of important public questions fairly,
objectively and without bias. The public interest—and not
private—is paramount. These requirements are inherent in the
conception of public interest set up by the Communications Act
as the criterion of regulation.30
The non-advocacy requirement of the FCC’s Mayflower decision, as
well as the public need to receive fair interpretations of all meaningful sides
of important issues, came to be known as the Mayflower Doctrine.31
Basically, the ruling said that a broadcaster could not be an advocate through
personal editorials.32
Although the intent of the Mayflower decision was to increase
discussion of various issues of public importance, the broadcasting industry
decided to avoid any potential trouble from the non-advocacy requirement
by avoiding discussing controversial issues altogether.33 In mid-1945, the
FCC sought to resolve the dilemma by requiring licensees to present
controversial issues; the FCC explained that “the operation of any station
under the extreme principles that no time shall be sold for the discussion of
controversial public issues . . . is inconsistent with the concept of public
interest established by the Communications Act as the criterion of radio
regulation.”34 The Commission not only rejected the practice of avoiding
discussions of issues over the air, but affirmatively indicated that a licensee

was, in fact, obligated to present such programs if it were to meet its
requirements vis-à-vis the public interest standard.35
Further elaboration of broadcaster obligations to promote fair
discussions of issues soon followed in the Commission’s rulings on the
separate petitions filed by Robert Scott and Sam Morris in 1946. In the Scott
case, the Commission took the significant step of ruling that even one side
of popularly accepted ideas could not be presented. Scott, an atheist,
requested, and was denied, time in which to refute the ideas advanced by
religious programming over the stations of which he complained in his
petition.36 The Commission denied his petition because the problem was
“broader in scope than the complaint against the particular stations . . .
involved.”37 “If freedom of speech is to have meaning,” the Commission
stated, “it cannot be predicated on the mere popularity or public acceptance
of the ideas sought to be advanced. It must be extended as readily to ideas
which we disapprove or abhor as to ideas which we approve.”38
The Commission held in In re Robert Harold Scott that while an issue
or personality may not seem to be important, it “may be projected into the
realm of controversy by virtue of being attacked.”39 The holders of a belief
should not be denied the right to answer attacks upon them or their belief
solely because they are few in number.40 In In re Sam Morris, the
Commission suggested that even advertising was not beyond the reach of
fairness treatment.41 The Commission held that, while the normal
advertising of a product or service does not usually raise issues of
importance, it must be recognized that under some circumstances it may well
do so; the fact that the occasion for the controversy happens to be an
advertisement does not diminish the duty of the broadcaster to treat it as an
issue of public interest.42
While the Scott and Morris decisions elaborated on a broadcaster’s
obligations, broadcast licensees needed more clarity in order to ensure that
they understood the FCC’s public interest and non-advocacy requirements,
and in the light of these compelling needs, the Commission initiated a study
to clarify its position with respect to the obligations of broadcast licensees in
the field of broadcast of news, commentary, and opinion.43 The result of this
inquiry was the opinion that would include the Fairness Doctrine.

42.1

Enter the Fairness Doctrine
The FCC laid out the Mayflower Doctrine during the height of World
War II, when restrictions on radio broadcasts were essentially unassailable
(after all, “loose lips sink ships”). As the national willingness to sacrifice
certain liberties for the sake of the war effort decreased, broadcast licensees’
disillusionment with the lack of clarity flowing from Mayflower-era FCC
decisions manifested itself. In response, in 1949, the FCC published a
report—In the Matter of Editorializing by Broadcast Licensees—which
contained the two provisions that would come to be known as the Fairness
Doctrine.44
The report interpreted the “public interest” provisions of the Radio Act
and the Communications Act as a mandate to promote “a basic standard of
fairness” in broadcasting.45 Accordingly, licensees had the duty to devote
airtime to objective, nonpartisan coverage of controversial issues that were
of interest to their home communities.46 Additionally, licensees had to
provide an opportunity to reply for individuals such as political candidates
or public officials who were the subject of editorials or who perceived
themselves to be the subject of unfair attacks in the licensees’ news
programming.47 Similarly, opposing candidates for public office were
entitled to equal airtime to express their platforms and promote their
campaigns.48 In the words of the FCC, the second of these requirements
mandated that broadcasters’ coverage of controversial issues “must be fair
in the sense that [the coverage of the issue] provides a reasonable opportunity
for the presentation of contrasting points of view.”49 Conspicuously absent,
however, was a concrete method of determining whether an issue was
“controversial,” what constituted a “reasonable opportunity to respond,” and
a guideline for what amount of programming devoted to important,
controversial issues would be considered reasonable.50
The Fairness Doctrine was predicated on the right of the public to be
informed, as opposed to a right shared by the Government, broadcast
licensees, and individual citizens to broadcast their exclusive views over the
airwaves; in other words, it was focused on the collective good rather than
on individual rights.51 This concept limited licensees’ discretion to some
extent, but it also advanced a more important goal—that of an informed

citizenry.52 The Commission told its licensees that it would provide fairness
guidelines on a case-by-case basis.53
In short, the Fairness Doctrine required that (1) broadcast licensees
devote a reasonable amount of their airtime to “controversial issues of public
importance,” and (2) when such issues were presented, contrasting views on
the issues had to be aired.54
The “Personal Attack” Rule
In the decade following the Fairness Doctrine’s birth, the FCC dealt
with “fairness problems” on an ad hoc basis.55 One aspect of the general
fairness concept dealt with equality in treatment of political candidates.56 In
a case involving a candidate seeking the office of Mayor of Chicago, the
FCC was petitioned to provide for equal time under Section 315 of the
Communications Act.57 The unfortunately-named mayoral candidate, Lar
Daly,58 claimed that his political opponents had been given exposure to the
public in station newscasts.59 The broadcasters felt that Section 315 should
not apply to bona fide newscasts; however, the Commission held that Daly
was entitled to equal time.60 Based on Lar Daly’s case, Congress amended
Section 315(a) of the Communications Act to exempt bona fide newscasts
from fairness requirements.61 The added portion reflected reaction to the Lar
Daly decision and recognized the goals of the Fairness Doctrine. Following
the revision, some stations presented both sides of controversial issues;
others were still unclear what to do vis-à-vis the fairness requirements; others
attempted to avoid fairness obligations altogether.62
One such attempt to circumvent the Fairness Doctrine occurred during
the 1962 California gubernatorial election, where a California network—
KTTV-TV—presented continuous, slanted commentaries by one of their
newsmen in support of one gubernatorial candidate.63 More than twenty of
these allegedly biased commentaries degraded the opposing party and the

opposing candidate; only twice was the opposing candidate allowed to
appear on KTTV, and each time his presentation was followed by a
rebuttal.64 The FCC ruled that under the Fairness Doctrine, when a
commentator on a broadcast licensee’s program attacks one candidate or
supports another, the station should send a transcript of the pertinent
continuity in each program to the appropriate candidates immediately and
should offer a comparable opportunity for an appropriate spokesman to
answer the broadcast.65 The FCC’s rationale was that a continuous
opportunity for one side to express their views and a minimal opportunity
afforded to opposite views violates the rights of the public to a fair and
balanced presentation of the issues.66
The personal attack provision required stations airing attacks on the
“honesty, integrity, character, or the like qualities” of a person to send the
person a tape, script, or accurate summary of the broadcast, a notification as
to the time of the broadcast, and an open invitation to respond to the
broadcast within one week of the attack—except in the case of “political
broadcasts,” in which cases the person must be notified within 24 hours.67
The Red Lion Decision and the Scarcity Principle
After the “Personal Attack Rule” came into existence, it seemed that
broadcast licensees had finally had enough of the FCC’s regulations. In
1969, the United States Supreme Court reviewed both the Personal Attack
Rule and the Fairness Doctrine itself in the case of Red Lion Broadcasting
Co. v. Federal Communications Commission.68
In Red Lion, Reverend Billy James Hargis “personally attacked” Fred
Cook during one program in a series of “Christian Crusades.”69 Cook wrote
WGCB—the licensee that broadcast the attack—asking for time to respond
to Hargis’s statements.70 In its response, WGCB suggested that Cook could
only respond if he paid WGCB, or obtained some other kind of
sponsorship.71 Cook responded with a proverbial “oh hell no,” and
petitioned the FCC for Fairness Doctrine consideration.72 The Commission
ordered the station to provide time for Mr. Cook’s reply.73 The station
appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which unanimously sustained

the validity of the Commission’s personal attack rules.74 The Court ruled
that broadcasters must make time available at their own expense in order to
meet their fairness obligations, and at their own initiative if content is not
available from other sources.75 Importantly, the Court noted:
[It] does not violate the First Amendment to treat licensees given
the privilege of using scarce radio frequencies as proxies for the
entire community, obligated to give suitable time and attention to
matters of great public concern. To condition the granting or
renewal of licenses on a willingness to present representative
community views on controversial issues is consistent with the
ends and purposes of those constitutional provisions forbidding
the abridgment of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.76
The crux of the Red Lion decision was that because of the scarcity of
radio frequencies with which broadcasters of any kind could relay
information (the “Scarcity Principle”), the FCC could constitutionally
mandate broadcasters to present important issues of public concern in as
unbiased a manner as possible.77 In fact, the Fairness Doctrine passed
Constitutional muster in part because of the right of the public to be informed
of controversial issues, as this complied with the spirit and purpose of the
First Amendment.78 Consistent with the FCC’s early rationale for regulating
mass communication, the Red Lion Court was keen to emphasize the right of
the public to be informed, and to receive information free from unnecessary
bias.79 While the Scarcity Principle was the backbone of the Red Lion
decision, the public’s right to information was its heart and soul.
In the decades following Red Lion, the Supreme Court examined and
upheld the Fairness Doctrine numerous times, but repeatedly declined to
extend its broadcast limitations to print media.80
The overarching theme of the FCC’s and Supreme Court’s decisions
regarding the Fairness Doctrine was the reiteration of the public’s right to be
informed, to hear important and controversial issues, and to have these issues
presented in a fair and objective manner.81

Farewell, Fairness Doctrine
In 1980, Ronald Reagan won the presidency, giving control of the
executive branch to the Republican Party, which generally opposed the
Fairness Doctrine. Five years later (in 1985), under FCC Chairman Mark S.
Fowler (a communications attorney who had served on Ronald Reagan’s
presidential campaign staff in 1976 and 1980), the FCC released its report
on General Fairness Doctrine Obligations, which argued that the doctrine
hurt the public interest and violated free speech rights guaranteed by the First
Amendment.82 The FCC ultimately abolished the Fairness Doctrine by a 40 decision in Syracuse Peace Council.83 The D.C. Circuit upheld the
Fairness Doctrine’s abolition, but was keen to note that it reached its decision
without addressing the First Amendment issues that the FCC raised.84
The Fairness Doctrine lay dormant on the Federal Register for decades,
through Republican and Democratic administrations alike, before meeting
its demise in 2011 during the Obama Administration.85 In the years that the
Fairness Doctrine lay dormant, public trust in media declined rapidly.86
Before the Syracuse Peace Council decision, 72% of Americans had a “great
deal” of trust in the news media; by 2000, that number had dipped to 51%.87
By 2016, that number had halved to 26%.88

Contemporary Issues in Media Distrust
In the Digital Age, the two foremost issues surrounding media distrust
are the perception of media outlets as biased, and—especially when it comes
to Internet-only sources—the widespread publication of false information
presented as news (i.e., “fake news”).89 An electorate that overwhelmingly

distrusts the media creates two problems: (1) an uninformed electorate,
casting votes based on incomplete, biased, or fraudulent fact reporting, and
(2) an increasingly polarized population, whose preexisting biases and
political animosities are exacerbated by the consumption of factually
irreconcilable accounts of national and global affairs.90
Media Bias
America’s trust in the media reached an all-time low in 2016.91 Leading
up to the 2016 Presidential Election, only 32% of American adults expressed
either a “great deal” or a “fair amount” of trust in mass media, compared to
over half of American adults expressing similar sentiments following the
highly controversial 2000 Presidential Election.92 Among surveyed
individuals aged 18-49 years—the heirs apparent to American policymaking
and voter impact with the impending deaths of older demographics—only
26%of those surveyed had a great deal or even fair amount of trust in mass
media in 2016.93
Gallup points out that the recent crater in media trust can be attributed
largely to the 2016 election itself. The perception among many Republican
voters was (and to a very large extent still is) that mainstream media outlets
such as CNN spent too much time focusing on controversial statements made
by then-candidate Donald Trump, while spending far less time reporting on
controversial issues surrounding the Clinton campaign.94
Generally speaking, Democratic voters trust media outlets more so than
Republican voters; 67% of polled Republican voters perceived a great deal
of political bias in mainstream media outlets, as opposed to 46% of
Independent voters, and only 26% of Democratic voters.95 By the same
token, only 13% of polled Republican voters believed that most media
outlets are careful to separate fact from opinion, compared to 27% of
Independent voters, and 53% of Democratic voters.96 In fact, according to
Gallup, out of seventeen newspapers, network or cable news stations, radio
networks, and Internet sites included in its survey, Republican voters saw all
but two—Fox News and the Wall Street Journal—as biased.97

Regardless of political leanings, studies indicate that two-thirds of
American adults believe that mainstream media outlets do a poor job of
separating facts from opinions.98
What most of these surveys do not account for is the direction the
people surveyed perceive the mainstream media to be biased—that is,
whether the survey takers believed overall mainstream media to have proDemocratic or pro-Republican bias. The natural presumption is that
Republican survey takers who perceived a media bias believed that the
mainstream media favored a more Democratic agenda, and that Democratic
voters perceived a Republican-leaning bias, but the studies are unclear in this
regard.
Regardless of public perception, there is no question that there are major
media outlets expressing pro-Republican and pro-Democratic biases alike.
The biases of various media outlets’ biases are perhaps best illustrated by
patent attorney Vanessa Otero, who has meticulously compiled a spectrum
of the reliability of a wide variety of media outlets, both in terms of bias and
in terms of objective, truthful fact reporting.99 Otero has developed a
methodology (Figure 1100) that grades a source’s content based on its veracity
(how factually accurate each claim is, with a value of 1 being wholly accurate
and 5 being completely false) and expression (whether a source presents
facts wholly objectively, with 1 being fact-only and 5 being opinion-only).
An algorithm then places the sources along an X-Y axis, with the Y-axis
indicating factual accuracy, and the X-axis reflecting objectivity.101
As Otero points out, two examples of perceived and objective media
bias can be seen in the conservative-leaning Fox News, and the progressiveleaning MSNBC.102 Economists at Stanford University further objectified
the existence, and explored the effects, of the biases of Fox and MSNBC.103
They found that if Fox News was removed from the cable news market,
Republican candidates across the board would have received 6.3% fewer
votes during the 2008 election.104 For reference, this would be nearly nine
million fewer votes, which is more votes than there are people in all but
eleven U.S. States.105 Regardless of whether someone considers that a good
or a bad thing, the ability to influence millions of votes undeniably connotes
a significant amount of power.

Notwithstanding the biases of individual networks, a prime example of
bias in media can be found in the Sinclair Broadcast Group (“Sinclair”): the
largest media conglomerate in the United States, owning over 200 stations
across the country, and providing broadcasting to nearly 40% of American
households.106 Sinclair has been criticized for using its many stations to push
Republican presidential candidates since at least 2004, when it announced it
would air a documentary critical of Democratic candidate John F. Kerry’s
service in the Vietnam War, but backed down amid pressure.107 It drew
criticism from Democrats on the eve of the 2012 election when its stations
in several battleground states aired a half-hour news special that faulted thenPresident Obama for his handling of the economy, his spearheading of the
Affordable Care Act, and the terrorist attack on a U.S. installation in
Benghazi, Libya.108 It is important to note that among the sources describing
Sinclair as having a conservative bias is the Wall Street Journal: one of only
two mainstream outlets that Republican (i.e. conservative) voters in a Gallup
poll perceived to be an unbiased source.
Fraudulent Online “News”
“Do you really think someone would do that—
just go on the Internet and tell lies?”109
What Republican and Democratic voters can agree on, however (and it
is increasingly rare that they agree on anything at all) is that fraudulent online
content purporting to be news is a problem; 71% of Democratic voters that
Gallup surveyed in 2018 believed that the spread of inaccurate information
on the Internet is a major problem, as did 75% of Republican voters.110 There
is, moreover, a stark disparity between Americans’ overall trust in traditional
media outlets (television, radio, etc.), and Americans’ overall trust in news
promulgated predominately via social media, and the Internet at large. Per
the Pew Research Center, only 5% of Americans have “a lot of trust” in news
that they see on social media.111

In other words, voters who would argue that the world is flat just to
spite the other side, are in agreement that websites propagating intentionally
false or misleading information are a massive problem.
A prime example of intentionally false or misleading online content
holding itself out as news is the group of websites run by conspiracy theorist
Alex Jones: namely, InfoWars, NewsWars, and PrisonPlanet.
Alex Jones and his variety of online outlets entered the spotlight during
the 2016 Presidential Election with the infamous “Pizzagate” event.
Pizzagate originated in the weeks leading up to the Election, as WikiLeaks
released emails from Clinton campaign advisor Chuck Podesta, including
correspondence between Podesta and the owner of Comet Pizzeria in
Washington, D.C. discussing a potential Clinton fundraiser event.112
Essentially, Jones and a variety of other site runners and bloggers alleged
that the word “pizza” in these emails was code for a child prostitution ring—
run and personally participated in by Hillary Clinton—being operated
beneath the pizzeria, and that the fundraisers at issue were going to be gangrapes of children.113 Not only were these allegations completely untrue, as
no evidence of a child prostitution ring was ever found, but they prompted a
gunman to fire shots inside the pizzeria in the process of “checking on” the
allegations.114
Although InfoWars is not a household name in the same way that Fox
News and CNN are, it carries considerable weight online in terms of page
views; the website receives nearly four million monthly page views, making
it more commonly-viewed than reputable sources like Newsweek and The
Economist.115 Though InfoWars is possibly the most well-known fake news
site, there are more fake news sites than can be counted.
“Who would actually believe most of these stories?”
The trouble is that many fake news websites disguise themselves as
bone a fide news, and many do so fairly convincingly. Anecdotally, most
people would glance at a poorly-thrown-together website clearly made by
some random guy eating Cheetos in his basement, and dismiss it as . . . well,
nonsense written by some random guy Cheetos in his basement. The fact of
the matter is that many fake news websites are not only professionally made,

but are given names such as “World News Daily Report” or “The Boston
Tribune” that carry the connotation of being legitimate news.
For example, when scrolling through their newsfeed in the months
following the 2016 Election, a person may have seen a headline from ABC
News announcing that President Obama had just signed an executive order
declaring an investigation into voter fraud, and that the Election was to be
held again in several weeks.116 As ABC News is a reputable source,117 this
person would likely give this claim a good deal of credence. The problem,
however, is that no such executive order was ever given, and “ABC News”
was not the same ABC News that has come to be a household name.118 The
fraudulent “ABC News” site uses a logo that is strikingly similar to that of
the real ABC News, and is located at the domain “abcnews.com.co” rather
than simply “abcnews.com.”119
One way that fake news outlets like the imposter “ABC News,” as well
as other fake news sites like the Boston Tribune and World News Daily
Report, escape responsibility for publishing outright false information is by
placing very inconspicuous disclaimers on their web pages, purporting
themselves to be “parodies.”120 However, unlike actual parody news sites
like The Onion, which makes it clear that its stories are satirical, the content,
tone, and presentation of the above-mentioned “fake news” sites are such
that it is clear that they intend their content to be received as fact, rather than
satire. World News Daily Report’s website, for example, is adorned with
the tagline “News You Can Trust,” which intentionally implies
authenticity.121 The fact that World News Daily Report—a microcosm of
the fake news epidemic—places this misleading statement prominently, but
essentially hides its satire disclaimer, makes it abundantly clear that its
publishers intend its content to be perceived as fact.
Nevertheless, even when something actually is satirical, or otherwise
presented purely for entertainment, it is not uncommon for consumers of that
media to perceive it as factual reporting. Even as long ago as 1938, when
Orson Welles’s infamous “War of the Worlds” broadcast, an appreciable
number of people—as many as a third of listeners—gleamed from the
broadcast that a Martian attack on the Earth was underway.122

“Who actually goes to these sites?”
Other than the odd conspiracy theorist who goes out of his way to visit
them, most of these websites’ views result from links shared on social media
platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.123 One person (often either a robot
or a starving twenty-something-year-old in a freezing apartment in Saint
Petersburg) shares the article from the source, their friends and subscribers
see and share the article, and then these users’ friends share the article, and
so the proverbial wheels on the bus go ‘round and ‘round.124
While it is true that many of these articles are reshared ad nauseum by
the above-mentioned robots and Russians, the majority of fake news article
“shares” came from verified human users within the United States, according
to research done by Professor Sinan Aral of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.125 Predictably, elderly users are the most susceptible to sharing
fake news on social media, as they accounted for over seven times the shares
of fake news articles during the 2016 election cycle as did their younger
counterparts.126
Concerningly, Professor Aral noted that fake news articles spread much
more rapidly on social media than bone a fide news from reputable
sources.127 According to Aral, “[f]alsehood diffused significantly farther,
faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of
information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news
than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends,
or financial information.”128 In fact, Aral’s study found that true information
took almost six times as long as false information to reach a sample of 1,500
people.129
With the widespread distrust of the American people for mainstream
news media, the United States faces a vacuum of reliable information.
Unfortunately, that vacuum is being filled by websites like InfoWars and
World News Daily Report, which are replacing biased information with
outright false information. The result is a less and less-informed electorate,
and until a solution presents itself, that problem will only get worse. A

embellished over the years, a significant number of people still interpreted the broadcast as
fact reporting on an ongoing extraterrestrial attack).

potential solution to that problem would be to reinstate the FCC Fairness
Doctrine.

Re-Implementing the Fairness Doctrine?
The American public’s wholesale distrust of media could potentially be
remedied by re-implementing the Fairness Doctrine in some form.
Practical Effects
As statistics plainly show, Americans’ trust in broadcast media was at
its highest during the life of the Fairness Doctrine and has been on the decline
since the Fairness Doctrine’s demise.130 That decline coincides with a
quantifiable bias in media,131 which fuels the public’s distrust of mainstream
media.132
If Fairness Doctrine 2.0 required outlets like Fox and MSNBC to
objectively present opposing points of view on important issues, it would be
relatively easy to overcome both the perceived and objective components of
bias. MSNBC having to present objective information on the Republican
point of view on a given issue, for example, would have the twofold benefit
of (1) increasing objectivity and reducing bias, and (2) increasing the outlet’s
credibility among the public. In other words, this would not only be
beneficial for viewers, who would suddenly be receiving both sides of a story
rather than an extremely slanted view, but it would help outlets, as their
credibility (and, theoretically, views) would increase.
Furthermore, if the Personal Attack Rule were to make a resurgence as
part of Fairness Doctrine 2.0, outlets like Sinclair would be unable to air
derogatory content without giving the subjects of that content the chance to
respond.133 This would by no means prevent outlets from presenting this
information, but would afford the subjects of these attacks opportunity to
respond, which could either validate or refute whatever the outlet said.
The following sections explain the practical and legal obstacles that
Fairness Doctrine 2.0 would have to overcome in order to have an impact on
the problems of bias and fake news.
Support and Opposition
As the American public grew more and more disillusioned with
mainstream media throughout the 1990s and 2000s, support grew among the
public and legislators alike for the reimplementation of the Fairness
Doctrine. Interestingly, despite Democratic voters having a greater trust in
the media and a lower perception of overall bias in the media, support for

reimplementing the Fairness Doctrine has been much higher among
Democratic voters and policymakers than among their Republican
counterparts.
In 2005, Democratic Congresswoman Louise Slaughter introduced a
bill to create a “Fairness and Accountability in Broadcasting Act,” which
would reduce the length of a broadcast license from eight to four years, and
require broadcast licensees to cover important issues fairly, hold local public
hearings about its coverage twice a year, and document to the FCC how it
was meeting its obligations; essentially, reviving and codifying the Fairness
Doctrine.134 That same year, Democratic Congresswoman Maurice Hinchey
introduced the “Media Ownership Reform Act of 2005,” which would have
implemented rules almost identical to the Fairness Doctrine.135 However,
neither bill made it out of its respective committee.136 Other prominent
Democratic figures such as former President Bill Clinton and former
Secretary of State John Kerry have also publicly expressed interest in the
Fairness Doctrine’s reimplementation.137
Predictably, since Democratic lawmakers tend to support Fairness
Doctrine 2.0, Republican lawmakers generally oppose a new Fairness
Doctrine; notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s decision in Red Lion, many
Republicans and Libertarians see the Fairness Doctrine as an attack on First
Amendment protections for speech and the press.138 In 2007, thenCongressman Mike Pence co-sponsored a bill that would have become the
Broadcaster Freedom Act, purporting to prohibit the FCC, or any other
federal commission, from “prescrib[ing] any rule, regulation, policy,
doctrine, standard, or other requirement that has the purpose or effect of
reinstating . . . the requirement that broadcasters present opposing viewpoints
on controversial issues of public importance, commonly referred to as the
Fairness Doctrine.”139
Outside of the ivory towers of Capitol Hill’s patrician class, the
plurality of the plebian wretches across the United States supports reimplementing the Fairness Doctrine in some form. According to a study by
Rasmussen Reports, a 47% plurality of surveyed Americans supported

reimplementing the Fairness Doctrine in some form.140 This is to say nothing
of the vast majority who believe that bias is a serious problem in mainstream
news media.141
First Amendment Concerns—Red Lion and The Scarcity Principle
The biggest concern surrounding Fairness Doctrine 2.0 is the issue of
the First Amendment—namely, the concerns of restricting freedom of the
press and free speech.142 Right off the bat, assuming Fairness Doctrine 2.0
made no updates to its predecessor, it would have Supreme Court precedent
on its side regarding First Amendment concerns. As mentioned above, the
Supreme Court’s decision in Red Lion expressly held that because of the
public’s right to receive important and controversial information, the
Fairness Doctrine not only survived the First Amendment challenge, but
actually advanced the interests that the First Amendment was designed to
protect.143
While courts were reluctant to apply the Fairness Doctrine to written
editorials instead of exclusively informative broadcasts,144 there is precedent
for extending the Doctrine to editorials. The Mayflower Doctrine, the
Fairness Doctrine’s predecessor, was born out of a case concerning biased
editorials.145 The reception would, of course, not be glowing, but there is
certainly historical precedent for a Fairness Doctrine 2.0 being extended to
editorials.
The counterargument would be that the Red Lion holding revolved
around the Scarcity Principle, and that the Court upheld the Fairness
Doctrine because of the necessity of regulating the finite number of radio
frequencies available to broadcasters.146 Proponents of this argument would
likely point to the fact that when Red Lion was decided, the ability of
broadcast licensees to broadcast was actually quite limited (i.e., scarce),
while in the Digital Age, infrastructure and access to information are
exponentially better, creating many, many more pathways through which
information can reach viewers, listeners, or whatever verb a given person is

engaging in to receive said information.147 Thus, the argument would
conclude that the Scarcity Principle that was the backbone of Red Lion would
preclude a Fairness Doctrine 2.0 for the same reason that it allowed its
predecessor.
The rebuttal to that notion is twofold. First, “scarcity” need not apply
to the radio frequencies themselves. Rather, “scarcity” could be expanded
to the modern equivalent of finite resources in the journalism industry:
broadcast timeslots, channel placement, and viewership share.148 As
Gregory Martin and Ali Yurukonglu observe, the ordering of a channel in
the lineup (channel 1 versus channel 100, for instance) can have significant
effects on the viewership of news channels, with lower channels tending to
be far more popular.149 Furthermore, there are a finite number of viewers,
each of whom has a finite amount of time to consume news. This is
significant because it creates both a supply-side and a demand-side
scarcity:150 broadcasters are competing for the limited demand of the market
(i.e., viewers and/or listeners), and consumers must choose which sources of
media they consume in their limited time, and therefore—consciously or
unconsciously—the biases to which they will be subject. Furthermore, as
explained at great length in the foregoing sections, broadcast communication
has a long history and tradition of Congressional and Administrative
regulation because of the right of the public to be informed.151
This scarcity and long history of regulation, combined with the legal
fiction of broadcast spectrum scarcity explained in the following paragraphs,
is likely enough to overcome this Red Lion hurdle.
Second, and more importantly, in the context of the Red Lion holding
and the history of broadcast regulation, the concept of scarcity serves to
underline the duty of the federal government to make sure that the public has
access to objective coverage of important issues.152 Red Lion was the
culmination of a decades-long administrative, legislative, and judicial
adaptation to the evolving nature of mass communication, during which
every branch of the federal government emphasized the right of the public to

be informed over the right of broadcasters to disseminate information.153
Since the Radio Act of 1927, broadcasting has been regulated because the
public has a right to receive information.154 When the Communications Act
supplanted the Radio Act, Congress was determined to require that the
newly-created FCC had a duty to “serve the public interest.”155 The F.C.C.
noted during its infancy that a democratic society should be given maximum
opportunity to express diverse viewpoints on controversial issues, and,
importantly, maximum opportunity to hear and read the conflicting view of
others.156
As Justice White later wrote for the unanimous Red Lion Court, “[i]t is
the right of the public to receive suitable access to social, political, esthetic
[sic], moral, and other ideas and experiences which is crucial here . . . [t]hat
right may not constitutionally be abridged either by Congress or by the
FCC.”157 That right of access, based on the history and tradition of the
decisions of both the Court and the FCC, extends not only to access to that
information, but to the objective presentation of this information.158
Furthermore, “access” referred to the ability of broadcasters to broadcast
information vis-à-vis the chilling effect and self-censorship that opponents
of the Fairness Doctrine feared. However, as the Red Lion Court noted, “[i]t
is the right of the viewers and listeners, not the right of the broadcasters,
which is paramount.”159 The fact that the notion of the public’s right to
information was reiterated so often and so prevalently indicates that courts
and lawmakers did not consider it incidental to their decisions, but as the
governing principle necessitating the entire body of broadcast regulation.
Furthermore, as legal scholars such as Mark Lloyd and John Berresford
theorize, Red Lion’s Scarcity Principle was not only secondary to the
emphasis on the public’s right to be informed, but was intended as dicta,
which subsequent courts misinterpreted as the crux of the opinion.160 Lloyd
suggests that the scarcity principle was merely “[d]ictum that suggests the
Court was aware of the spectrum [of broadcast frequencies] as a public
resource,” and that the Red Lion opinion was only about the constitutionality
of FCC authority over broadcast licensees.161 According to Lloyd, the Red
Lion Court’s determination that there was a scarcity of broadcast frequencies

was not the conclusion of an engineering or economic analysis, but was the
result of a purely legal analysis based on precedent and the record that
centered on previous challenges to FCC authority.162
This is significant because, as Berresford points out in his 2005 FCC
Research Paper, “[t]he Scarcity [Principle] appears to assume that there is a
physical thing . . . of which there is a scarce amount . . . ‘the radio frequency
spectrum,’ however, has no discrete physical existence . . . [t]he Scarcity
[Principle] thus appears to be based on fundamental misunderstandings of
physics.”163 Arbitrary rules made up by dead racists are nothing compared
to the physical laws governing the reality of the known universe. The
question of scarcity was thus “dislodged from the question before the Court”
in Red Lion: Whether the FCC could constitutionally enforce the Fairness
Doctrine.164
If the Scarcity Principle is a legal fiction (based on a scientific one),
then Red Lion’s precedential value in upholding Fairness Doctrine 2.0 must
rest solely on the end that the very nature of broadcast regulation sought to
further from its inception:165 the right of the public to receive objective
information.166
Legal Issues Surrounding Online News and Social Media
Admittedly, the Fairness Doctrine was the product of a time when radio
and television was the primary means of mass communication, and the
concept of the Internet was as foreign to human civilization as originality is
to young adult fiction. While the Fairness Doctrine existed on the Federal
Register until 2011167—well past the advent of the Internet and 24-hour news
cycle—the FCC stopped enforcing it in 1987,168 at a time when the world
had not yet been introduced to The Simpsons, let alone mediums like
Facebook and Twitter. Setting aside the evolving nature of Internet law,
which is outside the scope of this article, Fairness Doctrine 2.0 would have
to overcome the Scarcity Principle to apply to online-based news and fake
news.

While Fairness Doctrine jurisprudence predated the Internet, courts
were extremely reluctant to extend the Fairness Doctrine or other limitations
on freedom of the press to print media.169 The reasoning was that unlike
broadcast media and frequencies, there was nothing “scarce” being protected
by applying the Fairness Doctrine to print media.170 Because there was (and
is) no shortage of paper, ink, and the necessary materials for newspaper, the
Scarcity Principle could not apply to print media.171
The Internet is, for all intents and purposes, infinite.172 While access to
online content depends on concerns like bandwidth allocation and access to
the Internet in general, the potential for individuals and news outlets—
genuine or otherwise—to share and see information online is effectively
limitless.173 Fairness Doctrine 2.0 could likely not reach the Internet based
on the Scarcity Principle alone.
However, as discussed in the foregoing section, the underlying
justification for the Fairness Doctrine was not the Scarcity Principle, but the
long history and tradition of protecting the public’s right to be informed.174
Coupling this principle with society’s increasing reliance on the Internet for
information, extending Fairness Doctrine 2.0 to online outlets would likely
pass Constitutional muster.

Potential Private Sector and Individual Solutions
So, what else can we do? The current news situation is less than ideal,
and because Fairness Doctrine 2.0 may not be able to reach online outlets,
fake news would still exist in that form. Regardless, we as a country can do
more than implement Fairness Doctrine 2.0 in order to restore trust in the
media.

believe that there simply is no source of unbiased news; per Gallup, 51% of
American adults cannot name a news source that they believe reports
neutrally and objectively.175 While some outlets such as the Associated Press
and Reuters are generally seen as less biased than the likes of MSNBC and
Fox News, the fact remains that a majority of Americans do not even
consider these sources free from partisan bias.
One option is for people to self-police—get their news from left-leaning
sources, right-leaning sources, and as neutral of a source as they perceive to
exist. Not only are most people unlikely to do this, as it requires effort, but
the nature of the evolving Internet makes it extremely difficult.176 Online
outlets like Google and Facebook have algorithms that present news and
other content based on what a user has previously viewed, creating a
veritable treadmill of one-sided sources.177
Eli Pariser explores this phenomenon in his 2011 book The Filter
Bubble.178 These algorithms essentially learn an individual user’s biases and
preferences and agendas based on the user’s frequent search terms, social
media posts, preferences, and those of that user’s friends, and tailor the
search results, ads, and news feeds that this user sees to conform with those
ideas.179 The result is that this user will see content that mostly conforms to
their political ideologies, and over time, exclusively such content.180 The
user is then left in a “filter bubble,” seeing—through no fault or even
awareness of their own—only information online that that conforms to their
pre-existing beliefs.181 As Pariser phrased it, “[a] world constructed from the
familiar is a world in which there’s nothing to learn . . . [since there is]
invisible autopropaganda, indoctrinating us with our own ideas.”182 In other
words, people truly have to go out of their way if (and that is a big “if”) they
want to see news that challenges their way of thinking. This seems unlikely
to occur on a large enough scale to combat the fake news epidemic.
Even if people went out of their way to find news sources that challenge
their points of view, the human mind is loath to accept ideas that it does not
already agree with.183 This phenomenon is called confirmation bias—the
notion that people tend to give more credence to ideas and stories that

reinforce their preexisting beliefs than to ideas that contradict them.184 In
other words, people naturally believe what they want to—we are obstinate
by design.
Any solution grounded in self-policing or reliance on the private sector
rather than a regulatory solution would have to overcome the massive
hurdles of the filter bubble and confirmation bias. For a nation like the
United States that was founded—and prides itself—upon steadfastness and
sticking to one’s convictions, these solutions would therefore likely be
unsuccessful.
Social Networks Self-Policing—“The Market Will Regulate Itself”
As discussed above, the bulk of online fake news is distributed and
consumed through links on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.185
Ordinarily, this is the type of thing that can be regulated by market forces
rather than by government intervention. Theoretically, if a product is bad or
a business provides poor services, consumers will simply switch to an
alternative. Businesses seek to fix bad practices in order to keep existing
customers and attract new ones. American history is replete with instances
of market forces purging counterproductive and harmful business practices
without the need for government intervention; slavery,186 unsanitary food
production,187 child labor,188 segregation,189 and the use of asbestos190 are
prime examples of this.191
In the context of social media, if one platform becomes notorious for fake
news, users will theoretically switch to a different platform, incentivizing the
original platform to crack down on that fake news. However, this
presupposes that alternatives exist. Facebook and Twitter combine for the
overwhelming market share of social media192 (surprisingly, Pinterest
accounts for over 16% of the social media market, but the same statistics

Businesses had no incentive to discontinue them, as moving away from these paradigms
would (and did) cost a tremendous amount of money. Absent governmental action, these
practices would have most likely continued far longer than they did, if not indefinitely.

indicate that Pinterest users do not get news there).193 Because there are so
few major social media platforms, users have few real alternatives to switch
to. Facebook and Twitter therefore have no economic incentive to take
sweeping measures to remove fake news from their platforms.
Admittedly, in recent years, these sites have taken moderate steps to
reduce the amount of fake news shared on their sites, such as deleting
accounts that routinely share fake news articles.194 Facebook has also put
public service ads on users’ feeds decrying fake news and the use of fake
accounts.195 In June 2018, Twitter announced that it would take efforts to
increase transparency by disclosing who pays for political ads on its site, and
how much those parties spend on those ads.196
Facebook has implemented several journalistic efforts, including its
partnership with fact-checking organizations, the Facebook Journalism
Project—which is aimed at helping newsrooms get more digitally savvy—
and the News Integrity Initiative, which Facebook helped in part to fund.197
However, as Matthew Ingram notes, these seem to be more public relations
stunts than anything else.198
As Ingram points out, “Facebook focuses on engagement—time spent,
clicks, and sharing—rather than quality or value.”199 This is because, like
most other social media sites, Facebook’s revenue come predominately from
advertising,200 which, online, is predicated around gathering views and
clicks; the more pageviews or clicks a site gets, the more valuable its ad
space is, and the more revenue it can generate through ad sales.201 In other

words, Facebook and other social media sites gets paid based on their site’s
traffic, regardless of the authenticity of the content they host.202
Because there is no economic incentive for social media sites to take
major steps towards purging fake news, it is very doubtful that the Social
Media market will regulate away fake news.
Watchdog Agencies
Partially in response to the rising bias in media and the epidemic of fake
news, entities like Politifact and Snopes appeared to fact-check claims by
politicians and news agencies alike. Politifact publishes objective, factchecked reports examining dubious claims from politicians and news sources
to “give citizens the information they need to govern themselves in a
democracy.”203 Snopes got its start in the mid-1990s debunking urban
legends and hoaxes, and has evolved into the Internet’s largest fact-checking
site.204 Both sites are replete with articles examining claims from politicians,
news outlets, and even viral political memes, and cite to original sources to
support their conclusions regarding a given claim’s accuracy.205
Websites like Facebook and Twitter have used independent factchecking organizations from across the political spectrum to identify false
and misleading information.206 However, as explained in the foregoing
section, these sites currently have no incentive to take lasting steps to keep
fake news from their platforms.
One way for people to make sure that they do not fall victim to fake
news is to cross-check media that they consume against reports on PolitiFact
or another watchdog site. However, in addition to sheer human laziness, this
does not take into account the issue of confirmation bias, where people are
reluctant to accept the idea that a proposition that confirms their beliefs is
incorrect.207 If people are loath to disbelieve stories with which they agree,
they are extremely unlikely to go out of their way to disprove them, even if
the stories are dubious on their face.

In short, people are not fans of being proven wrong, and will not seek
out opportunities for such punishment.
Good Ol’ Fashioned American Skepticism
We are, at the end of the day, each the masters of our own domain. We
as consumers choose where we get our news, and what steps we take to
ensure that the information we receive is legitimate. Whether or not Fairness
Doctrine 2.0 ever sees the light of day, the American people bear the burden
of seeking reliable journalism.
Although there is a ton of biased and otherwise unreliable journalism,
there is also a ton of objective, fact-based journalism. As reflected in the
foregoing discussion, news sources like the Associated Press, Reuters, and
CBS do a much better job of separating fact from opinion than outlets like
MSNBC and Fox News, and rarely (if ever) present stories that are simply
not grounded in fact.208 Furthermore, none of the Associated Press, Reuters,
and CBS require a paid membership to view their online content, so anyone
with Internet access can get news from them.209
Americans should—and, if trust in journalism is to be restored, must—
get more news from relatively unbiased sources like the Associated Press or
Reuters, get less news from biased sources like MSNBC and Fox News, and
completely avoid sources like Infowars and World News Daily Report,
which are, in the words of Vanessa Otero, “nonsense damaging to public
discourse.”210
Additionally, notwithstanding confirmation bias, Americans should use
fact-checking sites like Snopes and Politifact to corroborate or discredit
questionable claims. As difficult as it may be to go off the beaten path to
disprove a piece of ostensibly good news, the alternative is falling victim to
fraudulent claims and basing decisions on misinformation. The solution is
for us as consumers of media to swallow our pride and be skeptical of
dubious claims. We need to dismiss suspect news reports based on our own
sense of truth and falsity; if it sounds unlikely to have happened, it probably
did not.
Americans need to consume less news over social media, where fake
news spreads like wildfire. We should avoid websites like the Huffington
Post and Breitbart, which are extremely biased.211 Even if these are people’s
go-to news sites, it is not hard hard to set Chrome or Firefox to open to a set
of news pages that the user designates. If people set their browsers to open

up to news sites like Reuters or the Associated Press, they would
immediately see news from reliable, objective sources.
Furthermore, it is imperative that we educate children to be skeptical of
what they hear on the news or see online and encourage critical thinking
skills. The fundamentals of media literacy should occupy a central place in
middle school and high school curriculums, arming students with the critical
mind-set today’s media landscape demands.212 If children are able to
differentiate reliable sources of information from unreliable ones, the next
generation will be far better off in terms of finding good sources of news and
fostering an informed electorate.
Regardless of Fairness Doctrine 2.0 or other regulations, the onus is
ultimately on us to make sure that the news we consume is legitimate.

Conclusion
The United States is faced with a crisis of distrust in the media the likes
of which it has never seen before. Abject media bias and online fake news
have created a situation in which most Americans cannot even name an
unbiased news source. Because of its ability to hold broadcasters
accountable for the objectivity of their content, Fairness Doctrine 2.0 would
go a long way towards healing the wounds that media bias and fake news
have inflicted on American discourse.
At the end of the day, however, the burden to think critically, question
suspect claims, get information from reputable sources, and hold media
outlets accountable for the accuracy and objectivity of their reporting lies
upon us as consumers of media. The solution—if one can possibly exist—
is to heed the warnings of the elementary school computer lab teachers across
the country: think critically, and do not believe everything we read online.
As we scroll through Facebook or see an article come through our newsfeed,
it is up to us to ask, “[i]s Hitler’s son really writing a sequel to Mein
Kampf?”213 “[d]id the Clinton campaign really have a Democratic National
Committee employee murdered?”214 “[a]re Navy SEALs really disallowed
from wearing dark camouflage paint because of its similarity to
blackface?”215

On February 3, 2019, the Washington Post aired a Super Bowl ad
narrated by Tom Hanks, highlighting the importance of reliable journalism
to protect our right to credible information in a time when facts are
dispensable,216 objective reporting is scarce,217 and Americans’ trust in news
is at an all-time low.218 I can think of no better way to conclude than to echo
that sentiment:
When we go off to war, when we exercise our rights, when we
soar to our greatest heights, when we mourn and pray, when our
neighbors are at risk, when our nation is threatened, there’s
someone to gather the facts, to bring you the story, no matter the
cost—because knowing empowers us. Knowing helps us decide.
Knowing keeps us free.219
