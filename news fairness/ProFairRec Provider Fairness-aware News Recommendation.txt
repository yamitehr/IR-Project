ABSTRACT
News recommendation aims to help online news platform users find
their preferred news articles. Existing news recommendation methods usually learn models from historical user behaviors on news.
However, these behaviors are usually biased on news providers.
Models trained on biased user data may capture and even amplify
the biases on news providers, and are unfair for some minority news
providers. In this paper, we propose a provider fairness-aware news
recommendation framework (named ProFairRec), which can learn
news recommendation models fair for different news providers from
biased user data. The core idea of ProFairRec is to learn providerfair news representations and provider-fair user representations
to achieve provider fairness. To learn provider-fair representations
from biased data, we employ provider-biased representations to
inherit provider bias from data. Provider-fair and -biased news
representations are learned from news content and provider IDs
respectively, which are further aggregated to build fair and biased
user representations based on user click history. All of these representations are used in model training while only fair representations
are used for user-news matching to achieve fair news recommendation. Besides, we propose an adversarial learning task on news
provider discrimination to prevent provider-fair news representation from encoding provider bias. We also propose an orthogonal
regularization on provider-fair and -biased representations to better reduce provider bias in provider-fair representations. Moreover,
ProFairRec is a general framework and can be applied to different
news recommendation methods. Extensive experiments on a public

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, online news platforms such as Apple News have
become more and more popular for people to read news [41, 49, 55].
Since massive news articles are collected by online news platforms
from different news providers everyday [20, 45], it is very difficult
for users to manually find their interested news [42, 58]. Thus, news
recommendation, which aims to recommend news according to
users’ personal interest [28, 30, 57], has become very critical for
online news platforms to improve user experience [2, 11, 13, 31].
Most of the existing news recommendation methods first learn
news and user representations from news content and user reading
history respectively, and then match them for personalized news
recommendation [24, 56]. Besides, these methods usually rely on
historical users’ behavior data on news to train recommendation
models [37, 47]. For example, An et al. [1] employed an attentive
convolutional network to learn news representations from news
titles and categories. They proposed to capture short-term user
interest from user’s clicked news via a GRU network and long-term
user interest via ID embeddings and combined them to form user
interest representations. Besides, they further model user interest
in news based on the inner product of their representations and

exploit user historical click and non-click data for model training.
Wu et al. [44] proposed to learn news representations from news
titles, entities, and tags via transformers and proposed a heterogeneous graph pooling network to learn user representations from
personalized user graphs. Besides, they also performed interest
matching via inner product and trained models on click data.
In general, users’ reading behaviors on different news providers
are usually biased [21]. Some popular news providers may take
up most clicks while clicks on some minority news providers are
usually rare. Thus, news recommendation models trained on biased user data may capture and even amplify the biases on news
providers, which may tend to recommend more news from popular
providers and become unfair for some minority news providers [27,
33, 52]. For example, Fig. 1 shows the average exposure number
of news from different news providers in the real-world news recommendation dataset MIND [50], we can see that news exposures
are biased on different news providers. Fig. 2 shows average numbers of news from popular and unpopular providers recommended
by several SOTA news recommendation models trained on MIND.
Fig. 2 verifies that models learned from biased data can capture
provider bias and become unfair for minority providers. However,
most of the existing news recommendation methods do not consider
provider fairness, which may hurt the diversity of news sources
and perspectives, as well as the revenue of minority providers [34].
In this paper, we propose a provider fairness-aware news recommendation framework named ProFairRec, which can improve
provider fairness of recommendation models learned from biased
data. The core idea of ProFairRec is to learn provider-fair news
and user representations. In order to learn provider-fair representations from biased data, we utilize provider-biased representations to inherit bias from data. Specifically, for news modeling, we
learn provider-fair news representations from news content and
learn provider-biased news representations from provider IDs. For
user modeling, we learn provider-fair and -biased user representations by aggregating provider-fair and -biased representations
of users’ clicked news, respectively. We aggregate provider-fair
and -biased representations of news and users for training the
recommendation model to achieve decomposition of bias-aware
and bias-independent information and only match provider-fair
news and user representations to achieve fair news recommendation. In addition, we propose an adversarial learning task on news
provider discrimination and apply it to provider-fair news representations to prevent them from encoding provider bias. We also
design an orthogonal regularization that enforces provider-fair and

-biased representations to be orthogonal for better reducing bias
in provider-fair representations. Moreover, ProFairRec is a general
framework and can be applied to different news recommendation
models. We conduct extensive experiments on a public news recommendation dataset. Results show that ProFairRec can effectively
improve the provider fairness of many news recommendation methods and meanwhile maintain their recommendation accuracy.
The contribution of this paper is three-fold:
• To our best knowledge, we are the first to study the provider
fairness problem in news recommendation.
• We propose a unified framework to learn provider-fair news
representations and user representations from biased data.
• Extensive experiments verify that ProFairRec can effectively
improve provider fairness of many news recommendation
methods without significant accuracy drop.

2 RELATED WORK
2.1 News Recommendation
News recommendation technique is important for users to improve
their experience on online news platforms [4, 18]. Mainstream news
recommendation methods usually first model news from its content and model user interest from user’s clicked news, and further
match user interest with candidate news for news recommendation [17, 36, 41, 42, 46]. Besides, these methods usually train recommendation models on historical user behavior data. For example,
Wu et al. [43] proposed to apply self-attention networks to learn
news representations from news texts and learn user representations from user behavior contexts. They further measured user
interest in candidate news based on the inner product of their representations. Qi et al. [32] proposed to learn news representations
from news titles and entities via transformer networks. They further
proposed to learn hierarchical user representations to model diverse
and multi-grained user interest for matching candidate news. Moreover, both of these two methods trained news recommendation
models on click and non-click data. In general, historical click data
on different news providers are usually biased. Popular providers
may accumulate most clicks while click data on some minority

ProFairRec: Provider Fairness-aware News Recommendation

news providers are usually rare. However, existing news recommendation models trained on historical data may inherit provider
bias and become unfair for some minority news providers. Different
from these methods, we propose a decomposed framework with
adversarial learning, which can effectively reduce provider bias in
news recommendation models learned from biased data.

2.2

Fair Recommender System

In recent years, fair recommender systems have attracted more
and more attentions [6, 15, 23, 52]. Existing works usually consider recommendation fairness from two perspectives, i.e., user and
provider [3]. Many existing fair recommender systems were proposed to improve user-side fairness [16, 48]. Some of these methods
were designed to provide unbiased recommendations for users with
different sensitive attributes (e.g., genders and ages) [48, 51] while
some of them were proposed to provide recommendation services
with equal qualities for users in different groups (e.g., user groups
partitioned by gender) [7, 15, 54]. Different from these user-side
fair recommendation methods, our ProFairRec framework focuses
on provider-side recommendation fairness. There are also some
works that have been proposed to improve provider-side recommendation fairness [3, 33]. These methods are usually designed to
provide equal recommendation opportunities for different news
providers [23, 25, 52]. For example, Liu et al. [21] proposed to rerank candidate items based on their relevance with user interest and
proportion of protected providers (e.g., minority providers) in recommendation lists. Sonboli et al. [33] proposed to prompt provider
fairness by enhancing recommendation diversity. They proposed to
re-rank candidate items based on their matching with user interest
as well as intra-list item similarities. Wu et al. [52] proposed to
use the difference between the proportion of protected providers
in the recommendation list and item set as a constraint to re-rank
candidate items. In short, these methods are usually based on manually designed re-ranking rules to re-balance the recommendation
opportunities of different news providers to improve provider fairness. However, the manually designed re-ranking rules may be
sub-optimal for achieving an effective trade-off between recommendation fairness and accuracy. Different from these methods, we
propose a unified provider fairness-aware news recommendation
framework to reduce provider bias in recommendation models with
adversarial learning, which can jointly optimize recommendation
fairness and accuracy during model training.

METHODOLOGY

We will first give a formal definition on news recommendation
and provider fairness in it. Then, we will introduce our provider
fairness-aware news recommendation method (named ProFairRec).

3.1

Problem Formulation

In news recommendation, we assume that there are 𝐻 news providers
in total: P = {𝑃𝑖 |𝑖 = 1, ..., 𝐻 }, where 𝑃𝑖 is the ID of the 𝑖-th provider
and P is the set of news providers. The set of news articles belonging to the provider 𝑝 ∈ P is denoted as D𝑝 and the set of all news
articles is denoted as D. For each news article 𝑑 ∈ D, we assume
that the article 𝑑 is composed of the textual content 𝑐 and the ID of
its provider 𝑝, i.e., 𝑑 = {𝑐, 𝑝}. Besides, we assume that the textual

SIGIR ’22, July 11–15, 2022, Madrid, Spain.

content 𝑐 is composed of 𝑇 words: 𝑐 = [𝑡 1, ..., 𝑡𝑇 ], where 𝑡𝑖 is the 𝑖-th
word. For each target user 𝑢 ∈ U, we assume that the target user
𝑢 ], where
has previously clicked 𝑚 news articles [𝑑𝑢1 , ..., 𝑑𝑖𝑢 , ..., 𝑑𝑚
𝑑𝑖𝑢 is the 𝑖-th news clicked by the target user and U is the set of
𝑛 ] and a target
users. Given a list of candidate news [𝑑 1𝑛 , ..., 𝑑𝑖𝑛 , ..., 𝑑 𝑁
user 𝑢, the recommendation model needs to predict the relevance
𝑐 ] for matching user interest and candidate
scores [𝑟ˆ1𝑐 , ..., 𝑟ˆ𝑖𝑐 , ..., 𝑟ˆ𝑁
news, where 𝑟ˆ𝑖𝑐 is the predicted relevance score of the 𝑖-th candidate
news and user interest. These candidate news are further ranked
based on their relevance scores and the news recommender system
will only display part of candidate news with the highest relevance
scores. The goal of provider fairness-aware news recommendation
is to recommend news according to user interest and meanwhile
provide fair exposure opportunities for different news providers.
Following existing works [3, 33], we employ group-level fairness
concept to define provider fairness to reduce the influence of the
quality differences of news from different providers. News providers
are first partitioned into multiple groups {P𝑖 |𝑖 = 1, 2, ..., 𝑔} based
on concerned provider features (e.g., provider popularity [33] or
provider revenue [3]), where P𝑖 is the 𝑖-th group and 𝑔 is the number
of provider groups. The group-level provider fairness requires that
the recommendation model should provide equal recommendation
opportunities for news of providers in different groups:
Í
Í
Í
Í
Í

𝑢 ∈U 𝑝 ∈ P 𝑗 𝑑 𝑗 ∈D𝑝 1 (𝑑 𝑗 , 𝑢)

Í
Í
=
,
|U| 𝑝 ∈ P𝑖 |D𝑝 |
|U| 𝑝 ∈ P𝑗 |D𝑝 |
(1)
where 1 (𝑑, 𝑢) is an indicator function representing the strategy of
the news recommender system. The indicator function 1 (𝑑, 𝑢) will
output 1 if the news 𝑑 is recommended to the user 𝑢 and will output
0 if the news 𝑑 is not recommended to the user 𝑢.

3.2

Overall Framework

Next, we will introduce the overall framework of our provider
fairness-aware news recommendation framework (ProFairRec), which
can learn fair news recommendation models from biased data.
As shown in Fig. 3, the core idea of ProFairRec is to learn providerfair news and user representations to achieve provider fairness.
Note that training data usually contains both provider-biased signals (e.g., provider popularity) and provider-independent signals
(e.g., the matching of user interest and news content), it may be
difficult to employ a single news or user representation to purely
encode provider-independent signals without encoding providerbiased signals. To tackle this challenge, motivated by Wu et al.
[48], we employ provider-biased representations to inherit provider
bias from biased data to further learn provider-fair representations.
Specifically, given a news 𝑑 with its content 𝑐 and provider ID 𝑝,
ProFairRec employs a content model Φ𝑐𝑛 to learn provider-fair news
representation c from its content 𝑐, and a provider encoder Φ𝑛𝑝 to
learn provider-biased news representation p from its provider ID p:
c = Φ𝑐𝑛 (𝑐),

p = Φ𝑛𝑝 (𝑝).

(2)

The content model can be implemented by news modeling techniques proposed in existing methods [29, 39, 43]1 and the provider
encoder is implemented by the stack of a provider embedding layer
1 We will introduce the architecture of the content model in Section 3.5.

and an MLP network. Based on this decomposition, the providerbiased news representations have the potential to encode provider
bias in training data and provider-fair news representations have
the potential to purely encode bias-independent information. Next,
given a target user 𝑢, we apply the content model and the provider
encoder to her clicked news to obtain the corresponding provider𝑢 ] and provider-biased news

representations [p1 , ..., p𝑚 ], where c𝑢𝑖 and p𝑢𝑖 denote provider-fair
and -biased representations of the 𝑖-th clicked news 𝑑𝑖𝑢 , respectively.
Given a candidate news 𝑑 𝑛 , we also apply the content model and
the provider encoder to learn its provider-fair news representation
n𝑐 and provider-biased news representation n𝑝 .
Next, for user modeling, we also employ provider-biased representations to inherit provider-biased signals from training data to
learn provider-fair representations to capture user interest. We employ a fair user model Φ𝑢𝑐 to learn provider-fair user representation
u𝑐 from provider-fair representations of user’s clicked news:
𝑢
u𝑐 = Φ𝑢𝑐 ([c𝑢1 , ..., c𝑢𝑖 , ..., c𝑚
]),

u𝑝 from provider-biased representations of user’s clicked news:
𝑢
u𝑝 = Φ𝑢𝑝 ([p𝑢1 , ..., p𝑢𝑖 , ..., p𝑚
]),

(4)

where Φ𝑢𝑝 is also implemented by existing user modeling methods.
Based on this decomposition, provider-biased user representations
can encode biased signals in training data and provider-fair user
representations could purely encode bias-independent information.
Since training data usually contains provider bias signals, providerfair representations may inherit bias information if we only employ
them for model training. Thus, we use both provider-fair and -biased
representations of users and news for training to fit the distribution
of biased data. Provider-biased representations are used to inherit
bias from training data and provider-fair representations are used to
capture bias-independent information. In addition, to better prevent
provider-fair news representations from encoding bias, we propose
an adversarial learning task on news provider discrimination and
apply it to provider-fair news representations. We also propose
an orthogonal regularization and apply it to the provider-fair and
-biased representations of both user and news to better eliminate
bias in provider-fair representations. Thus, ProFairRec has the ability to learn provider-fair representations from that purely encode

bias-independent information from biased data. Finally, we only use
provider-fair news and user representations for interest matching
to achieve provider fairness-aware news recommendation.

3.3

L𝑎 = E𝑑 ∈D [−y𝑝 · log ŷ𝑝 |Ψ∗ ].

Model Training

Next, we will introduce the training framework of ProFairRec in
detail. Following existing works [1, 43], we also train news recommendation models on historical user click data. As mentioned above,
user click behaviors on news providers are usually biased and training data may encode bias on news providers. News recommendation
models trained on biased data may inherit provider bias and become unfair for minority providers. To tackle this challenge, during
model training of ProFairRec, both provider-fair and provider-biased
representations are used for click prediction to fit the distribution
of biased training data. The provider-biased representations are
used to inherit provider bias from training data and provider-fair
representations are used to encode bias-independent information.
Specifically, we first aggregate provider-fair and -biased representation of user and news to learn bias-aware user representation u𝑎
and bias-aware news representation n𝑎 : u𝑎 = u𝑐 +u𝑝 , n𝑎 = n𝑐 +n𝑝 .
Next, we predict click score 𝑦ˆ𝑐 of the target user 𝑢 on the candidate
news 𝑑 𝑛 based on the matching of their bias-aware representations: 𝑦ˆ𝑐 = u𝑎 · n𝑎 . Following existing works [39, 40], we apply
the noise contrastive estimation (NCE) technique to formulate the
recommendation loss L𝑐 . We treat each news 𝑑 + clicked by the
user as a positive sample, and randomly select 𝐹 negative samples
[𝑑 1−, ..., 𝑑 𝐹− ] for each positive sample, where negative samples are
non-clicked news in the same impression with the positive sample
and 𝑑 −𝑗 denotes the 𝑗-th negative sample. Next we calculate the
click score 𝑦ˆ𝑐+ of the positive sample 𝑑 + and click scores [𝑦ˆ𝑐1 , ..., 𝑦ˆ𝑐𝐹 ]
of the negative samples. Finally, we obtain the recommendation
loss L𝑐 based on the NCE loss:
exp(𝑦ˆ𝑐+ )
L𝑐 = E𝑥∼Ω [− log(
)],
Í
𝑐
exp(𝑦ˆ+ ) + 𝐹𝑗=1 exp(𝑦ˆ𝑐𝑗 )

(5)

where Ω is the training dataset, 𝑥 is a training sample that is composed of a positive sample and 𝐹 negative samples.
Although in ProFairRec we employ provider-biased representations to inherit provider bias in training data, provider-fair representations may also encode some bias information. To protect
provider-fair representations from encoding provider bias, we propose an adversarial learning task to enforce provider-fair news
representations to be indistinguishable to different news providers.
We first employ a provider discriminator Ψ(·) to predict provider
of a news 𝑑 from its provider-fair representation c, i.e., ŷ𝑝 = Ψ(c),
where ŷ𝑝 ∈ R | P | denotes the predicted probability vector and its
𝑗-th element is the predicted probability of the news 𝑑 belonging
to the 𝑗-th provider 𝑃 𝑗 . We use an MLP network to implement the
provider discriminator Ψ(·):
ŷ𝑝 = 𝑠𝑜 𝑓 𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 (W𝑑e
c + b𝑑 ),

e
c = 𝑀𝐿𝑃 (c),

(6)

where W𝑑 and b𝑑 are trainable parameters, and 𝑀𝐿𝑃 (·) is an MLP
network. Next, we formulate the provider discrimination loss L𝑑
and minimize L𝑑 to learn the optimal provider discriminator Ψ∗ :
Ψ∗ = arg min L𝑑 ,
Ψ

where y𝑝 is the label of the provider of news 𝑑. After obtaining the
optimal provider discriminator Ψ∗ , we recalculate ŷ𝑝 based on Ψ∗
and further calculate the adversarial loss L𝑎 :

L𝑑 = E𝑑 ∈ D [−y𝑝 · log ŷ𝑝 ],

(7)

(8)

Based on this equation, we can calculate and employ the negative
adversarial gradients on the recommendation model as a penalty to
reduce provider bias encoded in provider-fair news representations.
Besides, to achieve a better decomposition of provider bias and
bias-independent information, we also apply an orthogonal regularization to provider-fair and -biased representations of both news
and users. For each news or user, orthogonal regularization constrains its provider-fair representation to be orthogonal with the
corresponding provider-biased representation. We first calculate cosine similarities between provider-fair and -biased representations,
and then calculate the orthogonal regularization:
L𝑢 = E𝑢 ∈U [|𝑠𝑢 |],

𝑠𝑢 =

L𝑛 = E𝑑 ∈D [|𝑠 𝑛 |],

𝑠𝑛 =

u𝑐 · u𝑝
,
||u𝑐 || 2 ||u𝑝 || 2
n𝑐 · n𝑝

(9)

,
(10)
||n𝑐 || 2 ||n𝑝 || 2
where 𝑠𝑢 is the cosine similarity between provider-fair and -biased
representation of the user 𝑢, 𝑠 𝑛 is the cosine similarity between
provider-fair and -biased representation of the news 𝑑, L𝑢 and L𝑛
denote the user and news orthogonal regularization, respectively.
Finally, we combine different loss functions into an overall optimization objective L for model training:
L = 𝜆𝑐 L𝑐 + 𝜆𝑢 L𝑢 + 𝜆𝑛 L𝑛 − 𝜆𝑎 L𝑎 ,

(11)

where 𝜆𝑐 , 𝜆𝑢 , 𝜆𝑛 , 𝜆𝑎 are hyper-parameters controlling the weights
of loss L𝑐 , L𝑢 , L𝑛 and L𝑎 , respectively.

3.4

Fair News Recommendation

Next, we will introduce the fair recommendation framework of
ProFairRec. After training the recommendation model on user data,
provider bias is enforced to be encoded in provider-biased representations and be reduced from provider-fair representations. Since
provider-fair representations only encode bias-independent information, we can match provider-fair news and user representations
to achieve fair news recommendation. Thus, given a target user 𝑢
and a candidate news 𝑑 𝑛 , based on the content model and fair user
model, we first learn provider-fair news representation n𝑐 for the
candidate news 𝑑 𝑛 and provider-fair user representation u𝑐 for the
target user 𝑢. We further match them to model user interest in candidate news without being affected by provider bias: 𝑟ˆ𝑐 = 𝜎 (u𝑐 ·n𝑐 ),
where 𝑟ˆ𝑐 is the predicted unbiased click probability and 𝜎 (·) is the
sigmoid activation function. Finally, given a target user 𝑢 and a
𝑛 ], we can predict unbiased
list of candidate news [𝑑 1𝑛 , ..., 𝑑𝑖𝑛 , ..., 𝑑 𝑁
click probability for each candidate news and further rank these
candidate news for recommendation.

3.5

Recommendation Model

As mentioned in Section 3.2, the content model and the user model
of ProFairRec can be implemented by news modeling and user modeling techniques proposed in existing methods. Thus, ProFairRec
is model-agnostic and can be combined with existing news recommendation models to improve their provider fairness. Next, we will

briefly introduce the architecture of mainstream news recommendation models. These models usually contain a content model to
learn news representations from textual news content and a user
model to learn user representations from users’ reading history.
The content model contains three major components, i.e., a word
embedding layer, a textual context modeling network, and a text
pooling network. Given words in news content, they are first converted into a word embedding via the word embedding layer. Next, a
textual context modeling network is applied to the word embedding
sequence to capture relatedness among words and learn contextual representations for them. This text context modeling network
can be implemented by various NLP techniques, such as CNN network [1, 14], LSTM network [9, 50], and transformer network [5, 35].
Finally, contextual word representations are aggregated by the text
pooling network to obtain a news representation d. The text pooling network can be implemented by various pooling operations,
such as average pooling [38] and attention network [39].
The user model usually contains two major components, i.e., a
behavior context modeling network and a behavior pooling network. User’s clicked news are first converted to news embeddings
via the content model. Then we apply a behavior context modeling
network to understand user interest from user behavior contexts.
It takes embeddings of user’s clicked news as input and generates
contextual news representations. This layer is usually implemented
by some effective sequence modeling techniques, such as GRU network [1, 24] and multi-head self-attention network [43]. Next, we
apply the behavior pooling network to build user interest representation u. It is usually implemented by attention network [39, 43].

4 EXPERIMENT
4.1 Datasets and Experimental Settings
We conduct extensive experiments on a public news recommendation dataset [50] (MIND)3 to evaluate model performance and
fairness. MIND is constructed by click data of 1 million uss on the
Microsoft News4 from October 12 to November 22, 2019 (6 weeks).
User data in the first four weeks are used to construct click history,
user data in the last week are used to construct the test set and
other user data are used to construct the training and validation
set. Besides, since MIND does not contains provider information,
we extract them from the website via a web crawler. More details
of the MIND dataset are in Table 1.

i.e., NRMS [43], to implement the content and user model of ProFairRec. The content model is based on the stack of a word embedding
lay, a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) network, and an attention
pooling network. Specifically, the word embedding layer is initialized by pre-trained 300-dimensional Glove word embeddings [26]
and fine-tuned in experiments. The MHSA network is set to contain
20 attention heads, and the output dimension of each head is set
to 20. The attention network is implemented by a two-layer MLP
network. The user model is based on the stack of an MHSA network
and an attention pooling network. Similarly, the MHSA generates
400-dimensional output vectors, and the attention pooling network
is a two-layer MLP network. Besides, for the provider encoder, the
400-dimensional provider embeddings are randomly initialized and
fine-tuned in experiments. We randomly select 4 negative samples
for each positive sample to formulate the recommendation loss L𝑐
and set its weight 𝜆𝑐 to 1. Both the weights 𝜆𝑢 and 𝜆𝑛 of news and
user orthogonal regularization L𝑢 and L𝑛 are set to 1. In addition,
since there are many providers in MIND which brings difficulties to
the convergence of the adversarial learning, we retain 50 providers
with the most clicks and merge other providers into a single class
category for discrimination. Besides, following Goodfellow et al. [8],
we iteratively train discrimination and adversarial task for a single
step rather than finding the optimal discriminator in practice. The
weight 𝜆𝑎 of the adversarial loss L𝑎 is set to 0.004. We utilize the
Adam algorithm [12] with 0.0001 learning rate for model optimization. We select hyper-parameters based on the validation dataset.
Codes are released at https://github.com/taoqi98/ProFairRec.
Following existing works [1, 5, 50], we use AUC, nDCG@10 and
MRR for recommendation evaluation. Besides, following existing
works [3, 53], group-level fairness metrics are used for fairness
evaluation and provider popularity is used for group partition. We
evaluate the provider fairness based on the difference of exposure
number of providers in a protected group and an unprotected group.
Providers are first ranked based on their average click number,
where unpopular providers ranked in the bottom 𝑟 % are partitioned
into the protected group P + while others are partitioned into the
unprotected group P − . Fairness is evaluated under different 𝑟 : 10%,
30% and 50%. Following existing works [3, 53], we employs two

Performance Evaluation

In this section, we compare ProFairRec with baseline methods on
both recommendation performance and provider fairness. The first
group of baseline methods includes several mainstream news recommendation methods: (1) GRU [24]: using a text auto-encoder
to learn news representations and a GRU network to learn user
representations. (2) DKN [38]: proposing a knowledge-aware CNN
network to learn news representations from news texts and entities. (3) HiFi-Ark [22]: proposing to learn multiple achieved user
representations to model diverse user interest. (4) NAML [39]: learning news representations from news titles, topics, subtopics, and

bodies via an attentive CNN network. (5) NPA [40]: proposing personalized attention networks to learn news representations from
news titles and user representations by aggregating user’s clicked
news. (6) KRED [19]: proposing a knowledge-aware graph attention
network to learn news representations from news texts, entities,
and neighbors of entities on knowledge graphs. (7) GNewsRec [10]:
modeling long-term user interest from news-user graph via a GNN
network and short-term user interest from users’ recent clicked
news via a GRU network. (8) LSTUR [1]: learning user representations by combining short-term user interest inferred from reading
history via a GRU network and long-term user interest modeled by
user ID embeddings. (9) NRMS [43]: proposing to use multi-head
self-attention networks to learn news and user representations.
The second group of baseline methods includes several provider
fairness-aware recommendation methods. (1) OFAiR [33]: re-ranking
items based on personalized relevance and provider unfairness of
recommendation results. (2) TFORM [52]: dynamically re-balancing
the exposure opportunities of providers based on their historical
exposures. Note that these methods apply re-ranking techniques
to improve the provider fairness in item recommendation and cannot be directly applied to the news recommendation task, thus we
apply the core re-ranking techniques in them to re-rank recommendation results of NRMS as baseline provider fairness-aware
news recommendation methods for comparisons. Besides, since
the trade-off between recommendation performance and fairness
of these two baseline methods and ProFairRec can be adjusted via

hyper-parameters, we compare the provider fairness of them under similar recommendation performance for fair comparisons. We
repeat each experiment five times and report average results.
Table 2 shows the recommendation performance of different
methods and Fig. 4 shows the provider fairness of different methods. From these results, we have several findings. First, baseline
news recommendation methods tend to recommend news of popular providers. This is because user click data on news providers are
usually biased. Recommendation models trained on biased data may
learn some shortcuts on news providers for recommendation and
may be unfair for some minority news providers. Second, our ProFairRec method outperforms baseline news recommendation methods on provider fairness. This is because we propose to decompose
provider bias and bias-independent information of user data into
provider-biased and -fair representations and only employ providerfair representations for news ranking. Besides, we also propose an
adversarial learning task on provider discrimination and orthogonal regularization to achieve better bias decomposition. Third, our
ProFairRec method effectively outperforms baseline fair recommendation methods on provider fairness when their recommendation
performance are similar. This is because existing provider fairnessaware recommendation methods are usually based on re-ranking

techniques. These methods independently optimize model performance and fairness and may only achieve a sub-optimal trade-off
between performance and fairness. Different from these methods,
our ProFairRec method jointly optimizes recommendation performance and provider fairness based on adversarial decomposition
technique, which can more effectively improve provider fairness
of news recommendation models. Forth, compared with baseline
news recommendation methods, our ProFairRec method can achieve
comparable or even better recommendation performance. These
results validate that our ProFairRec method can effectively improve
recommendation fairness and meanwhile accurately recommend
users’ interested news as existing news recommendation methods.

4.3

Generalization of ProFairRec

As mentioned above, ProFairRec is a general framework and we can
combine ProFairRec with models of existing news recommendation
methods to improve their fairness. Thus, to verify the generalization
of ProFairRec, we apply ProFairRec to several news recommendation
models that achieve good recommendation performance in Table 2,
i.e., NAML, KRED, NPA, NRMS and LSTUR and evaluate their fairness and performance. Specifically, we first employ the adversarial
training framework of ProFairRec to learn fair user and news models for these methods. Then we employ the fair recommendation
framework of ProFairRec for recommendation based on the fair user
and news models in these methods. Results on provider fairness are
summarized in Table 3 and results on recommendation performance
are summarized in Table 4. Due to space limitations, we only show
results under the protected provider group with 𝑟 = 50%. From
these results, we find that our ProFairRec approach can effectively
and consistently improve the provider fairness of existing news
recommendation models with minor performance decline. This is
because our ProFairRec approach employs provider-biased representations to inherit provider-bias signals from the biased training
data and thereby can learn provider-fair representations via adversarial learning for both user and news to achieve provider fairness
in news recommendation. In addition, our ProFairRec approach is
a model-agnostics framework, which can be combined with existing news recommendation methods to improve their fairness.
These results further validate the effectiveness and generalization
of ProFairRec on improving provider fairness.

Ablation Study

Next, we conduct an ablation study to evaluate the effectiveness of
several important modules in ProFairRec, i.e., provider-biased representations, adversarial learning, and orthogonal regularization, on
the provider fairness by removing them individually. Results are
summarized in Fig. 5, from which we have three findings. First, after
removing the provider-biased representations, provider fairness of
ProFairRec significantly declines. This is because training data usually includes both provider bias and bias-independent signals, and it
is difficult for a single news or user representation to purely encode
bias-independent information without encoding provider bias. To
tackle this challenge, ProFairRec decomposes provider bias and biasindependent information of biased data into provider-biased and
-fair representations respectively, and only employ provider-fair
representations for recommendation to improve provider fairness.
Second, adversarial learning can also improve the provider fairness
of ProFairRec. This is because provider-fair representations may
also inherit some bias information from biased training data. The
adversarial learning enforces provider-fair news representations
to be indistinguishable with respect to different news providers,
which can further prevent provider-fair news representations from
encoding provider bias. Third, removing the orthogonal regularization also hurts the provider fairness of ProFairRec. This may be
because the orthogonal regularization constrains the orthogonality of provider-biased and -fair representations, which can better
decompose provider bias and bias-independent information.

4.5

Influence of Hyper-Parameters

In this section, we will explore how the adversarial learning in
ProFairRec affects the recommendation performance and provider
fairness. We analyze its influence by evaluating ProFairRec under
different weights of the adversarial learning loss 𝜆𝑎 . Results are
summarized in Fig. 6, from which we have two major findings. First,
with the increase of 𝜆𝑎 , the recommendation fairness of ProFairRec
consistently increases. This is intuitive since larger 𝜆𝑎 makes it

more important for the model to reduce news provider information in provider-fair news representations, which can effectively
improve the provider fairness. Second, large 𝜆𝑎 hurts the recommendation performance of ProFairRec. This is because large 𝜆𝑎
makes the recommendation model overly emphasize the adversarial learning task while the recommendation task cannot get enough
respect. Thus, by adjusting 𝜆𝑎 , we can achieve a trade-off between
recommendation performance and provider fairness.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, we propose a provider fairness-aware news recommendation framework (ProFairRec), which can learn fair news recommendation models from biased user data. The core of ProFairRec is to learn provider-fair representations for both news and
users to encode bias-independent information for recommendation. Specifically, we propose to learn provider-fair and -biased
representations for news from their content and provider IDs respectively. These representations are further aggregated to build
provider-fair and -biased user representations based on user reading history. Both provider-fair and -biased representations are used
for model training while only provide-fair representations are used
for recommendation to improve provider fairness. In addition, we
apply adversarial learning to provider-fair news representations
to prevent them from encoding bias. We also apply orthogonal
regularization to provider-fair and -biased representations to better
reduce bias in provider-fair representations. Besides, ProFairRec is
a model-agnostics framework and can be applied to existing news
recommendation models to improve their fairness. Experiments on
a public dataset demonstrate that ProFairRec can effectively improve
the fairness of mainstream news recommendation methods with
minor performance declines. In our future work, we plan to apply
ProFairRec to improve provider fairness in more recommendation
scenarios (e.g. item recommendation).
