Reinscribing gender: social media, algorithms, bias

    ABSTRACT                                                                          KEYWORDS
    This article reflects on an apparent paradox – in light of cultural               Algorithms; gender; social
    shifts in gender, as well as a growing understanding of the multi­                media; bias; sexism;
    plicity of gender, internet algorithms tend to reinforce dualist,                 consumer culture
    hierarchical notions of gender. Algorithms exert profound influence
    on how gender is experienced, processed, and recirculated in con­
    temporary consumer culture. Thus, while consumers and research­
    ers embrace a broadening conception of gender, the online
    marketplace seems to be working to reinscribe stereotypical
    notions of gender. This paradox raises many important issues for
    research on gender and marketing.



Despite profound shifts in how gender identity is conceived, growing recognition, in
many places, of the multiplicity of gender, and striking strides in research on gender and
marketing, the technologies that underlie daily experience seem to be working to rein­
scribe gender, solidify the distinctions between male and female, and promote a dualistic
realm via algorithms that depend on entrenched notions of what men and women want
and need. Granted, Google’s gender settings include Male, Female, Custom, and Rather
Not Say. However, in practice, Google assigns dualistic categories of female or male in
their Google Ad Personalisation Page, which influences what ads will be shown to users,
with striking implications issues of choice, privacy and transparency (Nisha et al., 2019; see
also Noble, 2018).
   Google’s image search also reflects cultural biases – search for CEO and images of
white men dominate (Kay et al., 2015). Facebook, whose original mission was to make it
easy for Harvard undergraduates to rate female student’s attractiveness (Kirkpatrick,
2011), continues to deploy dualistic gender categories throughout its platform (e.g.,
Bivens, 2017). Much algorithmic work, of course, occurs in the background, without
consumer awareness. For gender researchers, the algorithmic relation to big data repre­
sents a crucial concern, particularly for its impact on consumer identity.
   I reviewed several papers recently on representations of gender for advertising and
media journals. All brought a nuanced conception of gender to bear on the shifting
terrain of gender as it appears in advertising (see, e.g., Coffin et al., 2019; Schroeder &
Borgerson, 2015). This work reflects a sense of ‘undoing of gender’ (Tissier-Desbordes &
Visconti, 2019, p. 307), as described in a recent special issue on ‘gender after gender’ in
Consumption Markets & Culture. In the last special issue on gender in this journal, the guest

editors suggested that ‘In contemporary consumer culture, however, these dualist cate­
gorisations and essentialist conceptualisations often break down and become problema­
tized’ (Arsel, Eräranta & Moisander, 2015, p. 1553). However, in the online world of
algorithms, dualist, sexist categories dominant, recirculate, and propagate.
    For example, one study created a basic ad that promoted STEM careers, with the text
‘Information about STEM careers’, along with a picture that depicted various STEM fields
(Lambrecht & Tucker, 2019). They placed the ad on Facebook in 191 countries, and found
that men saw the ad more than women, despite their efforts to make the ad ‘gender
neutral’. The researchers conclude:
    Women were far less likely to be shown the ad than men – but not because they
were less

  likely to click on it. If women ever saw the ad, they were more likely than men to click. Our
  finding suggests a nuanced view of the potential for apparent discriminatory outcomes even
  from “neutral” algorithms. (Lambrecht & Tucker, 2019, pp. 2977-2978)

Part of the explanation suggests that women are targeted with more ads for goods – the
landscape of social media advertising reflects the notion that women ‘are likely to engage
with advertising and because they traditionally control household expenses’ (Lambrecht
& Tucker, 2019, p. 2976). This study offers more clues into how algorithms reinscribe
gender, interacting with stereotypical notions about men’s and women’s career interests,
online behaviour, and consumer preferences.
   Moreover, algorithms have been shown to learn gender and incorporate gender
biases, thus reflect damaging stereotypes about women. A recent study shows how
gender figures in online reviews, including DVD reviews on Amazon and restaurant
reviews of Yelp: ‘Utilizing data from millions of observations and a word embedding
approach, GloVe, we show that algorithms designed to learn from human language
output, also learn gender bias’ (Mishra et al., 2019, p. 17). This study reveals how
algorithms pick up cultural biases and feed them back into the online environment,
without much awareness from users of what is happening, or how their social media
feed is built. They conclude:

  First, we show that more female images are shown when the search-query is negative (e.g.,
  impulsive shopper) than positive (e.g., sensible shopper). Second, we demonstrate that in
  the domain of product recommendation, biased recommendations can influence choices
  made by female consumers [. . .] Moreover, if these reviews are used to provide recommen­
  dations in the marketplace, it would result in women being recommended less career-
  oriented products e.g., less online courses, job advertisements, or even less paying jobs.
  (Mishra et al., 2019, p. 17)

In other words, algorithmic ‘choice’ may overwhelm consumer choice.
   Algorithms make up a growing influence of the daily visual consumption of consumers.
They influence what we read, what we see advertised, and ultimately what we buy. At
a basic level, algorithms impact the visual world that online consumers inhabit each day.
Marketing research is beginning to grapple with the implications of our algorithmically
driven world. However, at the same time that gender has been recognised as fluid,
dynamic, and multiple, algorithms often reinforce a dualistic, hierarchical, difference-
based mode of gender. And that seems like a problem.
