 newspapers in which the reports were published. This information is shown for the subset of reports for which information on the number of shares on social media
 was available (n = 429). In Europe we can observe a difference between the two maps, which can be explained by the fact that reports published in European
 newspapers only described events that occurred in other parts of the world. Because the online research of reports describing large carnivore attacks on humans was
 conducted in the English language, the area of North America is overrepresented. *We had no report for Antarctica and for the southern part of South America (i.e.,
 Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile, and Argentine) as well as for Iceland.

 FIGURE 4 | Comparison between: (A) presence and absence of images in media reports; and (B) species over the number of total shares (NTS) partial residuals.
 Reports that included one or more images were more frequently shared than reports without images. There were also differences between species over the NTS.
 Specifically, reports regarding alligator, brown bear, lion, shark, sloth bear and tiger were more shared on social media. The boxplots in (C) show comparisons
 between graphic (red) and non-graphic (white) reports over the square rooted NTS for each species. A strong difference between graphic and non-graphic reports is
 observed for lions, for which graphic reports were significantly more shared, while for sharks and alligators there were no marked differences. *Significant differences
