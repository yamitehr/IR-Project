                           We address the diffusion of information about the COVID-19 with a massive data analysis on Twitter,
                           Instagram, YouTube, Reddit and Gab. We analyze engagement and interest in the COVID-19 topic
                           and provide a differential assessment on the evolution of the discourse on a global scale for each
                           platform and their users. We fit information spreading with epidemic models characterizing the basic
                           reproduction number R0 for each social media platform. Moreover, we identify information spreading
                           from questionable sources, finding different volumes of misinformation in each platform. However,
                           information from both reliable and questionable sources do not present different spreading patterns.
                           Finally, we provide platform-dependent numerical estimates of rumors’ amplification.


                           The World Health Organization (WHO) defined the SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak as a severe global t­ hreat1. As
                           foreseen in 2017 by the global risk report of the World Economic forum, global risks are interconnected. In
                           particular, the case of the COVID-19 epidemic (the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered
                           human coronavirus) is showing the critical role of information diffusion in a disintermediated news ­cycle2.
                               The term infodemic3,4 has been coined to outline the perils of misinformation phenomena during the man-
                           agement of disease o   ­ utbreaks5–7, since it could even speed up the epidemic process by influencing and frag-
                           menting social r­ esponse8. As an example, CNN has recently anticipated a rumor about the possible lock-down
                           of Lombardy (a region in northern Italy) to prevent p     ­ andemics9, publishing the news hours before the official
                           communication from the Italian Prime Minister. As a result, people overcrowded trains and airports to escape
                           from Lombardy toward the southern regions before the lock-down was put in place, disrupting the government
                           initiative aimed to contain the epidemics and potentially increasing contagion. Thus, an important research
                           challenge is to determine how people seek or avoid information and how those decisions affect their b      ­ ehavior10,
                           particularly when the news cycle—dominated by the disintermediated diffusion of information—alters the way
                           information is consumed and reported on.
                               The case of the COVID-19 epidemic shows the critical impact of this new information environment. The
                           information spreading can strongly influence people’s behavior and alter the effectiveness of the countermeas-
                           ures deployed by governments. To this respect, models to forecast virus spreading are starting to account for
                           the behavioral response of the population with respect to public health interventions and the communication
                           dynamics behind content c­ onsumption8,11,12.
                               Social media platforms such as YouTube and Twitter provide direct access to an unprecedented amount of
                           content and may amplify rumors and questionable information. Taking into account users’ preferences and atti-
                           tudes, algorithms mediate and facilitate content promotion and thus information ­spreading13. This shift from the
                           traditional news paradigm profoundly impacts the construction of social ­perceptions14 and the framing of narra-
                           tives; it influences policy-making, political communication, as well as the evolution of public ­debate15,16, especially
                           when issues are c­ ontroversial17. Users online tend to acquire information adhering to their ­worldviews18,19, to
                           ignore dissenting ­information20,21 and to form polarized groups around shared ­narratives22,23. Furthermore, when
                           polarization is high, misinformation might easily p    ­ roliferate24,25. Some studies pointed out that fake news and
                           inaccurate information may spread faster and wider than fact-based n         ­ ews26. However, this might be platform-
                           specific effect. The definition of “Fake News” may indeed be inadequate since political debate often resorts
                           to labelling opposite news as unreliable or ­fake27. Studying the effect of the social media environment on the
                           perception of polarizing topics is being addressed also in the case of COVID-19. The issues related to the cur-
                           rent infodemics are indeed being tackled by the scientific literature from multiple perspectives including the

                                      dynamics of hatespeech and conspiracy t­ heories28,29, the effect of bots and automated a­ ccounts30, and the threats
                                      of misinformation in terms of diffusion and opinions f­ ormation31,32.
                                         In this work we provide an in-depth analysis of the social dynamics in a time window where narratives and
                                      moods in social media related to the COVID-19 have emerged and spread. While most of the studies on misin-
                                      formation diffusion focus on a single p  ­ latform17,26,33, the dynamics behind information consumption might be
                                      particular to the environment in which they spread on. Consequently, in this paper we perform a comparative
                                      analysis on five social media platforms (Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit and Gab) during the COVID-19
                                      outbreak. The dataset includes more than 8 million comments and posts over a time span of 45 days. We analyze
                                      user engagement and interest about the COVID-19 topic, providing an assessment of the discourse evolution
                                      over time on a global scale for each platform. Furthermore, we model the spread of information with epidemic
                                      models, characterizing for each platform its basic reproduction number (R0), i.e. the average number of second-
                                      ary cases (users that start posting about COVID-19) an “infectious” individual (an individual already posting
                                      on COVID-19) will create. In epidemiology, R0 = 1 is a threshold parameter. When R0 < 1 the disease will die
                                      out in a finite period of time, while the disease will spread for R0 > 1. In social media, R0 > 1 will indicate the
                                      possibility of an infodemic.
                                         Finally, coherently with the classification provided by the fact-checking organization Media Bias/Fact ­Check34
                                      that classifies news sources based on the truthfulness and bias of the information published, we split news outlets
                                      into two groups. These groups are either associated to the diffusion of (mostly) reliable or (mostly) questionable
                                      contents and we characterize the spreading of information regarding COVID-19 relying on this classification.
                                      We find that users in mainstream platforms are less susceptible to the diffusion of information from question-
                                      able sources and that information deriving from news outlets marked either as reliable or questionable do not
                                      present significant difference in the way it spreads.
                                         Our findings suggest that the interaction patterns of each social media combined with the peculiarity of the
                                      audience of each platform play a pivotal role in information and misinformation spreading. We conclude the
                                      paper by measuring rumor’s amplification parameters for COVID-19 on each social media platform.

                                      Results
                                      We analyze mainstream platforms such as Twitter, Instagram and YouTube as well as less regulated social media
                                      platforms such as Gab and Reddit. Gab is a crowdfunded social media whose structure and features are Twitter-
                                      inspired. It performs very little control on content posted; in the political spectrum, its user base is considered
                                      to be far-right. Reddit is an American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website based
                                      on collective filtering of information.
                                          We perform a comparative analysis of information spreading dynamics around the same argument in differ-
                                      ent environments having different interaction settings and audiences. We collect all pieces of content related to
                                      COVID-19 from the 1st of January to the 14th of February. Data have been collected filtering contents accord-
                                      ingly to a selected sample of Google Trends’ COVID-19 related queries such as: coronavirus, coronavirusout-
                                      break, imnotavirus, ncov, ncov-19, pandemic, wuhan. The deriving dataset is then composed of 1,342,103 posts
                                      and 7,465,721 comments produced by 3,734,815 users. For more details regarding the data collection refer to
                                      Methods.

                                      Interaction patterns. First, we analyze the interactions (i.e., the engagement) that users have with COVID-
                                      19 topics on each platform. The upper panel of Fig. 1 shows users’ engagement around the COVID-19 topic.
                                      Despite the differences among platforms, we observe that they all display a rather similar distribution of the
                                      users’ activity characterized by a long tail. This entails that users behave similarly for what concern the dynamics
                                      of reactions and content consumption. Indeed, users’ interactions with the COVID-19 content present attention
                                      patterns similar to any other ­topic35. The highest volume of interactions in terms of posting and commenting can
                                      be observed on mainstream platforms such as YouTube and Twitter.
                                          Then, to provide an overview of the debate concerning the disease outbreak, we extract and analyze the topics
                                      related to the COVID-19 content by means of Natural Language Processing techniques. We build word embed-
                                      ding for the text corpus of each platform, i.e. a word vector representation in which words sharing common
                                      contexts are in close proximity. Moreover, by running clustering procedures on these vector representations, we
                                      separate groups of words and topics that are perceived as more relevant for the COVID-19 debate. For further
                                      details refer to Methods. The results (Fig. 1, middle panel) show that topics are quite similar across each social
                                      media platform. Debates range from comparisons to other viruses, requests for God blessing, up to racism, while
                                      the largest volume of interaction is related to the lock-down of flights.
                                          Finally, to characterize user engagement with the COVID-19 on the five platforms, we compute the cumulative
                                      number of new posts each day (Fig. 1, lower panel). For all platforms, we find a change of behavior around the
                                      20th of January, that is the day that the World Health Organization (WHO) issued its first situation report on the
                                      COVID-1936. The largest increase in the number of posts is on the 21st of January for Gab, the 24th January for
                                      Reddit, the 30th January for Twitter, the 31th January for YouTube and the 5th of February for Instagram. Thus,
                                      social media platforms seem to have specific timings for content consumption; such patterns may depend upon
                                      the difference in terms of audience and interaction mechanisms (both social and algorithmic) among platforms.

                                      Information spreading. Efforts to simulate the spreading of information on social media by reproducing
                                      real data have mostly applied variants of standard epidemic ­models37–40. Coherently, we analyze the observed
                                      monotonic increasing trend in the way new users interact with information related to the COVID-19 by using
                                      epidemic models. Unlike previous works, we do not only focus on models that imply specific growth mecha-
                                      nisms, but also on phenomenological models that emphasize the reproducibility of empirical d­ ata41.

                            most discussed topics about COVID-19 on each social media. Lower panel: cumulative number of content
                            (posts, tweets, videos, etc.) produced from the 1st of January to the 14th of February. Due to the Twitter API
                            limitations in gathering past data, the first data point for Twitter is dated January 27th.

                                Most of the epidemiological models focus on the basic reproduction number R0, representing the expected
                            number of new infectors directly generated by an infected individual for a given time ­period42. An epidemic
                            occurs if R0 > 1,—i.e., if an exponential growth in the number of infections is expected at least in the initial
                            phase. In our case, we try to model the growth in number of people publishing a post on a subject as an infec-
                            tive process, where people can start publishing after being exposed to the topic. While in real epidemics R0 > 1
                            highlights the possibility of a pandemic, in our approach R0 > 1 indicates the emergence of an infodemic. We
                            model the dynamics both with the phenomenological model o      ­ f43 (from now on referred to as the EXP model)
                            and with the standard SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) compartmental ­model44. Further details on the
                            modeling approach can be found in Methods.
                                As shown in Fig. 2, each platform has its own basic reproduction number R0. As expected, all the values of R0
                            are supercritical—even considering confidence intervals (Table 1)—signaling the possibility of an infodemic. This
                            observation may facilitate the prediction task of information spreading during critical events. Indeed, according
                            to this result we can consider information spreading patterns on each social media to predict social response
                            when implementing crisis management plans.
                                While R0 is a good proxy for the engagement rate and a good predictor for epidemic-like information spread-
                            ing, social contagion phenomena might be in general more c­ omplex45–47. For instance, in the case of Instagram,
                            we observe an abrupt jump in the number of new users that cannot be explained with continuous models like

                            has been observed in any real-world epidemic.

                                      Questionable VS reliable information sources. We conclude our analysis by comparing the diffusion
                                      of information from questionable and reliable sources on each platform. We tag links as reliable or question-
                                      able according to the data reported by the independent fact-checking organization Media Bias/Fact C      ­ heck34. In
                                      order to clarify the limits of an approach that is based on labelling news outlets rather than single articles, as for
                                      instance performed ­in33,48, we report the definitions used in this paper for questionable and reliable information
                                      sources. In accordance with the criteria established by MBFC, by questionable information source we mean a
                                      news outlet systematically showing one or more of the following characteristics: extreme bias, consistent promo-
                                      tion of propaganda/conspiracies, poor or no sourcing to credible information, information not supported by
                                      evidence or unverifiable, a complete lack of transparency and/or fake news. By reliable information sources we
                                      mean news outlets that do not show any of the aforementioned characteristics. Such outlets can anyway produce
                                      contents potentially displaying a bias towards liberal/conservative opinion, but this does not compromise the
                                      overall reliability of the source.
                                          Figure 3 shows, for each platform, the plots of the cumulative number of posts and reactions related to reliable
                                      sources versus the cumulative number of posts and interactions referring to questionable sources. By interactions
                                      we mean the overall reactions, e.g. likes or other form or endorsement and comments, that can be performed
                                      with respect to a post on a social platform. Surprisingly, all the posts show a strong linear correlation, i.e., the
                                      number of posts/reactions relying on questionable and reliable sources grows with the same pace inside the same
                                      social media platform. We observe the same phenomenon also for the engagement with reliable and questionable
                                      sources. Hence, the growth dynamics of posts/interactions related to questionable news outlets is just a re-scaled
                                      version of the growth dynamics of posts/reactions related to reliable news outlets; however, the re-scaling factor
                                      ρ (i.e., the fraction of questionable over reliable) is strongly dependent on the platform.
                                          In particular, we observe that in mainstream social media the number of posts produced by questionable
                                      sources represents a small fraction of posts produced by reliable ones; the same thing happens in Reddit. Among
                                      less regulated social media, a peculiar effect is observed in Gab: while the volume of posts from questionable
                                      sources is just the ∼ 70% of the volume of posts from reliable ones, the volume of reactions for the former ones
                                      is ∼ 3 times bigger than the volume for the latter ones. Such results hint the possibility that different platform
                                      react differently to information produced by reliable and questionable news outlets.
                                          To further investigate this issue, we define the amplification factor E as the average number of reactions to a
                                      post; hence, E is a measure that quantifies the extent to which a post is amplified in a social media. We observe
                                      that the amplification E U (for unreliable posts posts produced by questionable outlets) and E R (for reliable posts

                            engagements is just a re-scaled version of the time evolution of reliable posts/engagements. Each plot indicates

                            and engagements (ρ eng ). In more popular social media, the number of questionable posts represents a small
                            fraction of the reliable ones; same thing happens in Reddit. Among less popular social media, a peculiar effect

                            and E R (for reliable post) vary from platform to platform, and are the largest in Twitter and the lowest in Gab.
                            The coefficient of relative amplification α = E U /E R measures whether a social media amplifies more unreliable

                            most neutral (α ∼ 1% i.e. E U ∼ E R ), while YouTube amplifies unreliable sources less (α ∼ 4/10). Among less
                            popular social media platforms, Reddit reduces the impact of unreliable sources (α ∼ 1/2) while Gab strongly

                            the largest values in YouTube and the lowest in Gab. To measure the permeability of a platform to posts from
                            questionable/reliable news outlets, we then define the coefficient of relative amplification α = E U /E R . It is a
                            measure of whether a social media amplifies questionable (α > 1) or reliable (α < 1) posts. Results are shown in
                            Table 2. Among mainstream social media, we notice that Twitter is the most neutral ( α ∼ 1 i.e. E U ∼ E R ), while
                            YouTube amplifies questionable sources less ( α ∼ 4/10). Among less popular social media, Reddit reduces the
                            impact of questionable sources ( α ∼ 1/2), while Gab strongly amplifies them ( α ∼ 4).
                               Therefore, we conclude that the main drivers of information spreading are related to specific peculiarities of
                            each platform and depends upon the group dynamics of individuals engaged with the topic.

                                      Conclusions
                                      In this work we perform a comparative analysis of users’ activity on five different social media platforms during
                                      the COVID-19 health emergency. Such a timeframe is a good benchmark for studying content consumption
                                      dynamics around critical events in a times when the accuracy of information is threatened. We assess user
                                      engagement and interest about the COVID-19 topic and characterize the evolution of the discourse over time.
                                          Furthermore, we model the spread of information using epidemic models and provide basic growth param-
                                      eters for each social media platform. We then analyze the diffusion of questionable information for all channels,
                                      finding that Gab is the environment more susceptible to misinformation dissemination. However, information
                                      deriving from sources marked either as reliable or questionable do not present significant differences in their
                                      its spreading patterns. Our analysis suggests that information spreading is driven by the interaction paradigm
                                      imposed by the specific social media or/and by the specific interaction patterns of groups of users engaged with
                                      the topic. We conclude the paper by computing rumor’s amplification parameters for social media platforms.
                                          We believe that the understanding of social dynamics between content consumption and social media plat-
                                      forms is an important research subject, since it may help to design more efficient epidemic models accounting
                                      for social behavior and to design more effective and tailored communication strategies in time of crisis.

                                      Methods
                                      Data collection. Table 3 reports the data breakdown of the five social media platforms. Different data col-
                                      lection processes have been performed depending on the platform. In all cases we guided the data collection by
                                      a set of selected keywords based on Google Trends’ COVID-19 related queries such as: coronavirus, pandemic,
                                      coronaoutbreak, china, wuhan, nCoV, IamNotAVirus, coronavirus_update, coronavirus_transmission, corona-
                                      virusnews, coronavirusoutbreak.
                                           The Reddit dataset was downloaded from the Pushi​ft.io archive, exploiting the related API. In order to filter
                                      contents linked to COVID-19, we used our set of keywords.
                                           In Gab, although no official guides are available, there is an API service that given a certain keyword, returns
                                      a list of users, hashtags and groups related to it. We queried all the keywords we selected based on Google
                                      Trends and we downloaded all hashtags linked to them. We then manually browsed the results and selected a
                                      set of hashtags based on their meaning. For each hashtag in our list, we downloaded all the posts and comments
                                      linked to it.
                                           For YouTube, we collected videos by using the YouTube Data API by searching for videos that matched our
                                      keywords. Then an in depth search was done by crawling the network of videos by searching for more related
                                      videos as established by the YouTube algorithm. From the gathered set, we filtered the videos that matched

                                      collected all the comments received by those videos.
                                           For Twitter, we collect tweets related to the topic coronavirus by using both the search and stream endpoint
                                      of the Twitter API. The data derived from the stream API represent only 1% of the total volume of tweets, further
                                      filtered by the selected keywords. The data derived from the search API represent a random sample of the tweets
                                      containing the selected keywords up to a maximum rate limit of 18000 tweets every 10 minutes.
                                           Since no official API are available for Instagram data, we built our own process to collect public contents
                                      related to our keywords. We manually took notes of posts, comments and populated the Instagram Dataset.

                                      Matching ability. We consider all the posts in our dataset that contain at least one URL linking to a website
                                      outside the related social media platfrom (e.g., tweets pointing outside Twitter). We separate URLs in two main
                                      categories obtained using the classification provided by MediaBias/FactCheck (MBFC). MBFC provides a clas-
                                      sification determined by ranking bias in four different categories, one of them being Factual/Sourcing. In that
                                      category, each news outlet is associated to a label that refers to its reliability as expressed in three labels, namely
                                      Conspiracy-Pseudoscience, Pro-Science or Questionable. Noticeably, also the Questionable set include a wide
                                      range of political bias, from Extreme Left to Extreme Right.
                                          Using such a classification, we assign to each of these outlets a binary label that partially stems from the
                                      labelling provided by MBFC. We divide the news outlets into Questionable and Reliable. All the outlets already
                                      classified as Questionable or belonging to the category Conspiracy-Pseudoscience are labelled as Questionable,
                                      the rest is labelled as Reliable. Thus, by questionable information source we mean a news outlet systematically
                                      showing one or more of the following characteristics: extreme bias, consistent promotion of propaganda/con-

                            complete lack of transparency and/or fake news. By reliable information sources we mean news outlets that do not
                            show any of the aforementioned characteristics. Such outlets can anyway produce contents potentially displaying
                            a bias towards liberal/conservative opinion, but this does not compromise the overall reliability of the source.
                                Considering all the 2637 news outlets that we retrieve from the list provided by MBFC we end up with 800
                            outlets classified as Questionable 1837 outlets classified as Reliable. Using such a classification we quantify our
                            overall ability to match and label domains of posts containing URLs, as reported in Table 4.The matching ability
                            that is low doesn’t refer to the ability of identifying known domain but to the ability of finding the news outlets
                            that belong to the list provided by MBFC. Indeed in all the social networks we find a tendency towards linking
                            to other social media platforms, as shown in Table 5.

                             Text analysis. To provide an overview of the debate concerning the virus outbreak on the various platforms,
                             we extract and analyze all topics related to COVID-19 by applying Natural Language Processing techniques to
                             the written content of each social media platform. We first build word embedding for the text corpus of each
                             platform, then, to assess the topics around which the perception of the COVID-19 debate is concentrated, we
                             cluster words by running the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm on their vector representations.
                                Word embeddings, i.e., distributed representations of words learned by neural networks, represent words as
                             vectors in Rn bringing similar words closer to each other. They perform significantly better than the well-known
                             Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for preserving linear regularities among
                             words and computational efficiency on large data ­sets49. In this paper we use the Skip-gram ­model50 to construct
                             word embedding of each social media corpus. More formally, given a content represented by the sequence of
                             words w1 , w2 , . . . , wT , we use stochastic gradient descent with gradient computed through backpropagation
                            ­rule51 for maximizing the average log probability
                                                                                                       
                                                                               T     k

                                                                            T

                            where k is the size of the training window. Therefore, during training the vector representations of closely related
                            words are pushed to be close to each other.
                               In the Skip-gram model, every word w is associated with its input and output vectors, uw and vw , respectively.
                            The probability of correctly predicting the word wi given the word wj is defined as

                            where V is the number of words in the corpus vocabulary. Two major parameters affect the training quality: the
                            dimensionality of word vectors, and the size of the surrounding words window. We choose 200 as vector dimen-
                            sion—that is typical value for training large dataset—and 6 words for the window.

                                          Before applying the tool, we reduced the contents to those written in English as detected with cld3. Then we
                                      cleaned the corpora by removing HTML code, URLs and email addresses, user mentions, hashtags, stop-words,
                                      and all the special characters including digits. Finally, we dropped words composed by less than three characters,
                                      words occurring less than five times in all the corpus, and contents with less than three words.
                                          To analyze the topics related to COVID-19, we cluster words by PAM and using as proximity metric the cosine
                                      distance matrix of words in their vector representations. In order to select the number of clusters, k, we calculate
                                      the average silhouette width for each value of k. Moreover, for evaluating the cluster stability, we calculate the
                                      average pairwise Jaccard similarity between clusters based on 90% sub-samples of the data. Lastly, we produce
                                      word clouds to identify the topic of each cluster. To provide a view about the debate around the virus outbreak,
                                      we define the distribution over topics c for a given content c as the distribution of its words among the word
                                      clusters. Thus, to quantify the relevance of each topic within a corpus, we restrict to contents c with max �c > 0.5
                                      and consider them uniquely identified as a single topic each. Table 6 shows the results of the text cleaning and
                                      topic analysis for all the data.

                                      Epidemiological models. Several mathematical models can be used to analyse potential mechanisms that
                                      underline epidemiological data. Generally, we can distinguish among phenomenological models that emphasize
                                      the reproducibility of empirical data without insights in the mechanisms of growth, and more insightful mecha-
                                      nistic models that try to incorporate such ­mechanisms41.
                                                                                                                    ­ f43 since it naturally provides an
                                          To fit our cumulative curves, we first use the adjusted exponential model o
                                      estimate of the basic reproduction number R0. This phenomenological model (from now on indicated as EXP) has
                                      been successfully employed in data-scarce settings and shown to be on-par with more traditional compartmental
                                      models for multiple emerging diseases like Zika, Ebola, and Middle East Respiratory S­ yndrome43.
                                          The model is defined by the following single equation:

                                                                                       I=                                                            (3)
                                                                                             (1 + d)t
                                      Here, I is incidence, t is the number of days, R0 is the basic reproduction number and d is a damping factor
                                      accounting for the reduction in transmissibility over time. In our case, we interpret I as the number Cauth of
                                      authors that have published a post on the subject.
                                         As a mechanistic model, we employ the classical SIR m   ­ odel44. In such a model, a susceptible population can
                                      be infected with a rate β by coming into contact with infected individuals; however, infected individuals can
                                      recover with a rate γ . The model is described by a set of differential equations:
                                                                                          ∂t S = −βS · I/N
                                                                                          ∂t I = βS · I/N − γ I                                       (4)
                                                                                          ∂t R = γ I
                                      where S is the number of susceptible, I is the number of infected and R is the number of recovered. In our case,
                                      we interpret the number I + R as the number Cauth of authors that have published a post on the subject.
                                          In the SIR model, the basic reproduction number R0 = β/γ corresponds to the ration among the rate of
                                      infection by contact β and the rate of recovery γ . Notice that for the SIR model, vaccination strategies correspond
                                      to bringing the system in a situation where S < N/R0; in such a way, both the number of infected will decrease.
                                          To estimate the basic reproduction numbers R0EXP and R0SIR for the EXP and the SIR model, we use least square
                                      estimates of the models’ ­parameters42. The range of parameters is estimated via b  ­ ootstrapping41,52.

                                      Linear regression coefficients. Table 7 reports the regression coefficient ρ, the intercept and the R2 values
                                      for the linear fit of Fig. 3. High values of R2 confirm the linear relationship between reliable and questionable
                                      sources in information diffusion.
