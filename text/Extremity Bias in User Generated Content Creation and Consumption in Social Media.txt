   ABSTRACT                                                                                                          KEYWORDS
   The present research finds support for an extremity bias in social media. User-generated                          Extremity; Instagram;
   content in social media is found to portray more extreme behavior than what is observed                           makeup; social media;
   in offline and nonmedia contexts. This bias is observed in the context of makeup-related                          social norms
   consumer behavior. Study 1 finds that consumers with higher (lower) self-reported extremity
   in their makeup style are more likely to create (consume) makeup-related content in social
   media. Likewise, Study 2 finds that makeup styles portrayed in social media are perceived
   as more extreme than those portrayed offline. Study 3 finds that the extremity bias,
   observed in the previous studies, can shift other perception; brief exposure to makeup styles
   on Instagram was found to lessen the perceived extremity of offline makeup styles. The
   results suggest that, like traditional media, content in social media may be biased toward
   extremity. This bias may be the result of motivational differences between creators versus
   consumers of social media content and may result in exposure to social media shifting
   social norms to more extreme levels.
