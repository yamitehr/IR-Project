                                           Abstract: Public health researchers are increasingly interested in the potential relationships between
                                           social media (SM) use, well-being, and health behavior among adolescents. However, most research
                                           has assessed daily SM time via self-report survey questions, despite a lack of clarity around the
                                           accuracy of such reports given the current tendency of youth to access SM on multiple electronic
                                           devices and cycle between multiple SM platforms on a daily basis (i.e., platform swinging). The

                                           and smartphones to track their active use of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat over a 2-week
                                           surveillance period and then self-reported their average daily minutes on each platform immediately
                                           after. Larger proportions of students over-estimated than under-estimated their use, with the largest

                                        1.1. Previous Research and Limitations
                                               Among the first to consider the potential for inaccuracy in retrospective reporting of
                                        SM time was Junco [18]. A software program was installed on the personal computers of
                                        participating college students to monitor the minutes per day they spent on Facebook over
                                        a 30-day period. Results revealed that students substantially overestimated their Facebook
                                        use, self-reporting an average of 145 min per day of active use while objectively logging
                                        only an average of 26 min. This study was limited in that it objectively tracked Facebook
                                        time on students’ computers but not on other devices (i.e., smartphones, tablets), and
                                        included a small sample (N = 49) of mostly female (73%) students preventing examination
                                        of sex differences. Moreover, fewer than half of the students who completed the baseline
                                        survey (which comprised only 17% of students to whom it was sent) agreed to install the
                                        computer tracking application, further limiting generalizability. In recent years, several
                                        studies have revisited the issue of self-report accuracy in the context of SM use, generally
                                        replicating two findings with larger samples: reporting inaccuracies are common, and they
                                        tend toward the direction of over-reporting [19,20]. However, these studies share substan-
                                        tial limitations with the initial investigation [18] including the assessment of SM time on
                                        one specific electronic device (iPhones) [20], a single platform [19], or lumping time on
                                        multiple SM platforms together to examine total time [15,20]. Due to these issues, findings
                                        and implications are limited in their usefulness to researchers designing new studies. For
                                        instance, in single device studies, some portion of participants’ reporting errors may be
                                        attributed to difficulty cognitively separating SM time on a specific device (i.e., iPhone)
                                        from total SM time across electronic devices (e.g., iPhone, tablet, and computer). Thus,
                                        participants may report total time across devices while only time on a specific device is
                                        tracked, artificially leading researchers to observe over-estimation. Further, findings from
                                        studies investigating self-report accuracy for total time across a broad category of SM have
                                        unclear implications for researchers who tend to be interested in the use of specific SM
                                        platforms [6,21] in order to inform the development of platform-specific health intervention
                                        or prevention efforts [22,23]. Previous studies require the assumption that self-report accu-
                                        racy is consistent across SM platforms used more and less frequently used by adolescents,
                                        despite some evidence that heavier SM use affords greater opportunity for reporting an
                                        error [20]. Additionally, few studies have investigated platform or participant-level factors
                                        that may increase the likelihood or degree of inaccuracy or over-reporting. Greater insight
                                        into these factors may help public health researchers investigating adolescents’ social media
                                        time optimize their methods.

                                        1.2. Explanations for Reporting Inaccuracy and Potential Systematic Predictors
                                              Social desirability [24,25], careless responding [26], the construction of self-report
                                        assessments [27,28], and social identity-related self-perception [29–31] are common ex-
                                        planations for measurement error in survey research with adolescents. Although youth
                                        are likely to perceive adult researchers to find their spending less time on SM more de-
                                        sirable than more time, adolescents and emerging adults have been found more likely to
                                        over-report this behavior, suggesting that social desirability concerns may not explain SM
                                        reporting inaccuracies well. However, recent findings suggest that careless responding
                                        may play at least some role in the inaccuracy of SM use estimations among adolescents.
                                        Sewall [20] highlighted associations between depressed mood, heavier iPhone-specific
                                        SM use, and larger discrepancies between objective assessment and self-reported iPhone-

                                        specific time on SM. Thus, the depressed mood appears to be one factor that may lead to
                                        inaccuracy potentially through a lack of motivation. Building on this work, this research
                                        examines how identity processes, self-perception, and use of specific SM platforms may also
                                        be implicated in the accuracy of self-reported use time and the direction of discrepancies.

                                        1.2.1. SM Platform
                                              Recent surveys of American adolescents have revealed patterns of frequent and heavy
                                        use of Snapchat and Instagram coupled with dwindling Facebook and Twitter engage-
                                        ment [32–35].. Meanwhile, research in the domain of behavior measurement suggests
                                        that self-reports of behavioral data are often inaccurate especially if the behaviors in ques-
                                        tion comprise habitual and indistinct events such as frequency of anger or smartphone
                                        use [36,37]. Given that recent data suggests that young adults may engage in the habitual
                                        use of some SM platforms (Instagram, Snapchat) more than others (Facebook, Twitter),
                                        it follows that there may also be platform-based differences in the accuracy with which
                                        students self-report their use. Likewise, Junco [18] proposed that students’ estimates of
                                        their Facebook use may have been inflated by stereotypes and media depictions of young
                                        adults as heavy Facebook users. However, since 2013, stereotypes around SM use have
                                        shifted considerably with Facebook now recognized as tremendously popular with older
                                        adults, and consequentially, less frequented by young people [38]. In contrast, today’s news
                                        stories, song lyrics, and television shows more frequently reflect the popularity of Insta-
                                        gram, Snapchat, and other image-based platforms among youth [39,40] potentially making
                                        young adults more likely to overestimate their own use of these popular SM platforms.
                                        This prediction is consistent with the finding that behaviors recognized to be normative
                                        in the peer group are commonly over-reported in surveys due to identity processes and
                                        self-perception [29–31].

                                        1.2.2. Reporter Sex
                                             Participant sex and gender may similarly impact the reliability of reporting on SM-
                                        related behaviors through identity-related processes. American females reliably self-report
                                        more time on SM than do males [41–43]. However, it remains unknown whether these
                                        sex differences in self-reported SM use coincide with objective reality or reflect artifacts of
                                        gendered self-perception. For instance, research suggests that females devote more of their
                                        online time to maintaining and cultivating interpersonal relationships whereas males tend
                                        to be more focused on information-seeking and non-social tasks [44]. Further, females tend
                                        to derive a greater sense of self through the strengths of their social ties and relationships
                                        than do males [45]. Thus, it stands to reason that heavy SM use may be perceived as
                                        more normative among females than males, potentially making females more likely to
                                        overestimate their time on SM.

                                        1.2.3. SM Platform Swinging
                                             The majority of young adults today engage in platform swinging, a term coined by
                                        Tandoc and colleagues [3] to describe the regular use of multiple SM platforms and the
                                        routine rotation or cycling of engagement between platforms. As a large proportion of the
                                        SM research conducted to date has focused on one platform (i.e., Facebook or Instagram),
                                        there has been very little consideration of platform swinging’s potential cognitive effects.
                                        For instance, it is unknown whether platform swinging reflects habitual behavior or more
                                        deliberate and conscious processes. Also unknown is the extent to which platform swingers
                                        are able to cognitively distinguish between their time on different platforms. Thus, with
                                        regard to SM research methods, a critical question lies in whether platform swinging
                                        impedes young adults’ ability to accurately report their time across the multiple SM
                                        platforms they use. That is, just as multitasking on mobile devices has been found to
                                        increase recall biases for different app usage categories [46,47] cycling engagement between
                                        a greater number of SM platforms may result in decreased accuracy when self-reporting
                                        time on individual platforms.

                                        1.3. The Current Study
                                             Building on Junco’s initial investigation [18], this study recruited a large sample of
                                        incoming college students and utilized a novel software application to track students’ active
                                        minutes per day using Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter across their electronic
                                        devices (personal computers, tablets, smartphones). Informed by Junco’s findings, we
                                        predicted that students would exhibit sizable inaccuracies in their self-reported use across
                                        platforms (H1) with students more likely to overestimate than underestimate their daily
                                        use (H2). Guided by research on the impact of identity and self-perception in the survey
                                        measurement context, poorer accuracy and greater over-estimations of use were expected
                                        for Instagram and Snapchat, relative to older platforms Facebook and Twitter, due to
                                        heavier actual use of these newer platforms by participants and media representations of
                                        young adults as heavy users (H3). Extending the same logic, we also predicted that female
                                        students would be more prone to inaccuracies and more likely to overestimate their SM
                                        use than male students (H4). Finally, we hypothesized that self-reporting use of a greater
                                        number of SM platforms during the surveillance period would increase the likelihood of
                                        substantially over-estimating time across SM platforms and on any given platform (H5).

                                        2. Methods and Materials
                                        2.1. Participants
                                             Participants were 320 matriculating college students recruited as part of a larger study
                                        investigating SM influences among incoming college students at a mid-sized university
                                        in the western United States. Recruitment took place over a two-week period in July of
                                        2018, prior to matriculation. To be eligible for the larger study, students had to be registered
                                        as an incoming first-year student, 18 years of age or older, in possession of an Apple or
                                        Android smartphone, active on at least one SM platform, and planning to live on campus
                                        during their first year. Interested students meeting eligibility requirements were invited to
                                        complete baseline assessments until the 320 spots in the study were filled, which occurred
                                        in approximately one week. The study’s sample was representative of the freshman class
                                        at the host university as the mean age of the sample was 18.60 years (SD = 0.26), 63% were
                                        female, 48% were Caucasian, 15% were Asian, 10% were African American, 17% were
                                        Hispanic, and 9% were multi-racial or other.

                                        2.2. Recruitment and Study Procedures
                                             Prior to the start of the fall semester, the Registrar’s office emailed incoming first-year
                                        students a link to the larger study’s informational website, which detailed all study proce-
                                        dures and included a link to a screening survey that allowed interested students to assess
                                        their eligibility. Eligible students were invited to participate and, after providing informed
                                        consent, completed a baseline survey. At the end of the baseline survey, participants were
                                        prompted to install a custom research version of the software application, RescueTime,
                                        onto their smartphones, tablets, and personal computers to track their Facebook, Instagram,
                                        Snapchat, and Twitter use over a two-week surveillance period. Blind to the RescueTime
                                        data being collected from their devices during this time, participants were texted and
                                        emailed a link to complete a short survey at the end of the two-week period. The first
                                        page of the survey prompted students to estimate their average daily minutes spent on
                                        each of the four SM platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat) over the pre-
                                        vious 2 weeks. Upon submission, participants with Android phones were directed to a
                                        personalized dashboard at which they could view their RescueTime SM time tracking data.
                                        However, as the RescueTime software application was not fully compatible with iPhones,
                                        participants with iPhones were first directed to a survey page that provided instructions
                                        for navigating to the application battery usage screen of their iPhone, using battery screen
                                        settings to display active SM application use data in minutes per day over the previous
                                        2 weeks, taking a screenshot of the data displayed, and uploading this screenshot into
                                        the survey. Following submission, they advanced to the RescueTime dashboard. The
                                        university’s Institutional Review Board approved all study procedures and measures.

                                        2.3.1. Demographics
                                            Participants reported basic demographic information including sex, age, race,
                                        and ethnicity.

                                        2.3.2. Objective Daily Time on SM
                                             A custom research version of RescueTime, a commercially available cross-device time
                                        management software program, was used in this study to track participants’ total minutes
                                        of active Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter use on their personal computers,
                                        tablets, and smartphones. Participants were required to install the custom application
                                        on at least two electronic devices (i.e., personal computers, tablets, smartphones) to track
                                        their SM use over a surveillance period spanning the first 2 weeks of August, prior to
                                        matriculation. During the surveillance period, participants could not view any of their
                                        RescueTime use data. Meanwhile, a data dashboard allowed the research team to check
                                        device installs for each participant and export CSV files detailing each participant’s total
                                        minutes spent actively using Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter applications and
                                        related websites across devices. Following the surveillance period, this data was exported
                                        and the total minutes of active use on each SM for each participant were divided by 14 to
                                        calculate an objective measure of average daily minutes spent on each SM platform during
                                        the 2-week period. In addition, average daily minutes on each SM were summed to derive
                                        an objective measure of total minutes per day on SM.

                                        2.3.3. Supplemental Battery Screen Data (iPhone Owners Only)
                                              As the RescueTime software application was not fully compatible with iPhones, iPhone
                                        owners were required to follow additional steps to ensure that the time they spent actively
                                        using the four SM platforms from their phones during the surveillance period could be
                                        combined with the data from their other electronic devices logged by RescueTime. After
                                        self-reporting their SM use at the end of the surveillance period, iPhone users were directed
                                        to a second survey page which provided detailed step-by-step instructions for navigating
                                        to the application battery usage screen of their iPhone, manipulating the battery screen
                                        settings to display active SM application use data in minutes per day over the previous
                                        2 weeks, taking a screenshot of the data displayed, and uploading this screenshot into
                                        the survey. Battery screen data documenting each iPhone user’s total minutes of active
                                        Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter IOS app usage over the 14-day period was
                                        pulled from these screenshots and added to each participant’s RescueTime derived total
                                        minutes of active use across their other devices (computers, tablets), prior to computing
                                        average daily use for each platform.

                                        2.3.4. Self-Reported Platform Use and Daily SM Time
                                             Immediately following the surveillance period, participants were sent a brief survey
                                        that prompted them to indicate the SM platforms they actively used during the previous
                                        2 weeks from a list that included Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram. Then, for
                                        each platform they reported using, participants were prompted to estimate their average
                                        minutes per day of active use over the previous 2 weeks. Platform-specific daily minute
                                        estimates were used individually in analyses and were also summed to create a composite
                                        measure of self-reported daily total time on SM.

                                        2.4. Analytic Plan
                                             First, patterns of SM platform use according to self-report and objective measures are
                                        examined via descriptive statistics and t-tests. Then, the prediction that students would
                                        exhibit significant inaccuracies in estimating their daily SM use (H1) is dually examined via
                                        paired sampled t-tests focused on discrepancies between measures of SM time and bivariate
                                        correlations between measures. Next, tests of directional hypotheses H2–H5, which focus
                                        on the likelihood of problematic overestimation versus underestimation versus accurate

                                       reporting of daily SM time, are evaluated by more meaningfully classifying participants
                                       based on the size and direction of their reporting discrepancies. Cut-points used to classify
                                       participants were informed by the distribution of reporting discrepancies in the sample as
                                       well as consideration of the degree of error that may be meaningful in the applied health
                                       research context. For each platform and across platforms, participants who self-reported
                                       use within ±9 min of their objective assessment are classified as “Accurate”, those who
                                       self-reported time 10 or more minutes less than their objective assessment are classified as
                                       “Underestimators”, and those who self-reported time exceeding their objectively logged
                                       time by 10 min or more are classified as “Overestimators”. The predictions that participants
                                       would be more likely to overestimate than underestimate their use overall (H2) and be
                                       more likely to overestimate their daily time on newer platforms relative to older platforms
                                       (H3) are evaluated by comparing proportions of participants classified as Underestima-
                                       tors, Overestimators, or Accurate Reporters via Chi-Square Goodness of Fit tests. Then
                                       to evaluate H4 and H5, multinomial regression models predicting participant accuracy
                                       classification (i.e., underestimator, overestimator, or accurate reporter) are examined for
                                       each SM platform and across all SM as functions of participant sex (H4) and the total
                                       number of SM platforms participants reported using (H5).

                                        3. Results
                                        3.1. Preliminary Analysis
                                                    Figure 1 compares the “users” of each SM platform in terms of the percentages of
                                            participants who self-reported active use versus objectively logged minutes of active use.

                                        under-estimating time on Snapchat. Meanwhile, female sex was not related to the likelihood
                                        of over-estimating or underestimating time on less used platforms Twitter or Facebook. In
                                        support of H5, holding constant sex, reporting use of a greater number of SM platforms was
                                        related to significantly greater odds of substantially over-estimating (relative to accurately
                                        reporting) total daily time on SM. Results varied somewhat by individual platform. Consis-
                                        tent with H5, using a greater number of platforms was associated with an increased odds of
                                        substantially over-estimating daily time on Instagram. Meanwhile, using a greater number
                                        of SM platforms was significantly associated with increased odds of both substantially
                                        over-estimating and under-estimating daily time on Snapchat and Twitter. In sum, as the
                                        number of SM platforms participants reported using on a daily basis increased, so did the
                                        likelihood of committing substantial inaccuracies in self-reporting total SM time as well as
                                        time on 3 of 4 the individual SM platforms of focus in this study.

                                        4. Discussion
                                             This study compared objective cross-device SM time-tracking data to self-reported
                                        daily SM time in order to investigate whether systematic reporting biases may obscure
                                        public health researchers’ understanding of psychosocial and behavioral correlates of SM
                                        use. Concerningly, many participants in this study were unable to accurately report the
                                        number of SM platforms they used during the 2-week surveillance period, reporting use of
                                        Facebook and Twitter during this period despite objectively spending no time at all on these
                                        platforms across their electronic devices. Further, examining the accuracy of self-reported
                                        daily time spent on four popular SM platforms individually across electronic devices
                                        yielded results largely consistent with those from previous studies focused on the use of a
                                        specific SM platform on a specific device [18]: inaccuracies were abundant and tended to be
                                        in the direction of over-estimation. However, in contrast to recent findings suggesting that
                                        inaccuracies in self-report are random and should not be of concern in survey research [15],
                                        results from this study revealed the likelihood of meaningful overestimation to be a function
                                        of both specific SM platform in question and participant sex. As expected, participants
                                        were more likely to overestimate time spent on the platforms they used more heavily (e.g.,
                                        Instagram and Snapchat) relative to those used less (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). Thus,
                                        platform-based differences in the accuracy of self-report may simply be a function of daily
                                        time spent on a platform (e.g., spending greater time on Instagram and Snapchat may make
                                        it more difficult to accurately report daily time on these platforms) rather than cognitive
                                        factors or platform characteristics. However, these findings are also consistent with the
                                        implicit theory explanation introduced by Junco [18] nearly a decade ago as well as sources
                                        of survey measurement error rooted in social identity and peer norms [29–31]. That is,
                                        because pop culture depictions of young people as particularly heavy users of Instagram
                                        and Snapchat are plentiful, adolescents’ estimates of their daily time on these platforms may
                                        also be inflated by perceptions of normative use among in-group peers. Similarly, results
                                        revealed that females spent more time than males on SM platforms considered normative
                                        amongst youth (Instagram and Snapchat) and are also more likely to overestimate their
                                        daily time on these SM. These findings are not surprising given that these SM platforms
                                        may help satisfy psychological needs that are typically stronger in females than males:
                                        cultivating interpersonal relationships [44] and deriving a greater sense of self through
                                        social ties [45]. Thus, females’ greater tendency toward over-estimation may be explained
                                        both by their greater time spent on particular SM and perceived gender-specific norms
                                        regarding the use of those platforms.
                                             Given the ever-expanding SM landscape and adolescents’ tendency toward platform
                                        swinging [3], this study’s most important finding may be the link between the number of
                                        SM platforms used during the surveillance period and the accuracy of self-reported time on
                                        individual platforms. In sum, as the number of SM platforms participants reported using
                                        increased, so did the likelihood of committing substantial inaccuracies in self-reporting total
                                        SM time as well as time on 3 of the 4 individual SM platforms assessed. Thus, it appears
                                        that platform swinging does indeed impede young adults’ ability to accurately estimate the
                                        time they spend on individual SM platforms and that cognitive bleed may occur between
                                        these online activities. These findings are consistent with those from previous studies
                                        linking greater cycling between mobile applications to greater recall bias [46,47] and taken
                                        together suggest that the phenomenon of misreporting time spent on SM may be a broader
                                        issue associated with multi-tasking on electronic devices.

                                        4.1. Implications for Researchers Studying Social Media Use among Adolescents
                                             This study was designed to closely map onto the self-report validity concerns of
                                        researchers increasingly interested in the degree to which cross-device time on one or
                                        more popular SM platforms is associated with the well-being or health behavior among
                                        adolescents. Findings suggest that self-report validity concerns in this literature are very
                                        much warranted as inaccuracies in self-reported SM time were found to be systematically
                                        related to the specific SM platform in question, participant sex, and the number of SM
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 9847                                                                               11 of 15




                                        platforms used regularly by participants. These findings are concerning as such systematic
                                        biases may obscure the true relationships between variables. For instance, the larger project
                                        from which the current investigation was derived examined prospective relationships
                                        between daily time on the four SM platforms during the transition into college in relation
                                        to subsequent perceptions of peer drinking norms and drinking behavior later in the school
                                        year. When objective data were used in analyses, as planned, the theorized model was fully
                                        supported [48]. However, when the model was re-run using self-report survey data from
                                        the same participants several key linkages were no longer supported (results available upon
                                        request) presumably due to the noise created by the reporting biases identified in the present
                                        study. Underscoring the importance of objective assessment in the SM use domain, reliance
                                        on only self-report measures would have led to the incorrect conclusion that daily SM time
                                        is not a predictor of drinking over the first year of college. Fortunately, compared to Junco’s
                                        initial study [18], where less than half of the participants who completed the baseline
                                        assessment installed the time-tracking software on their computers, the current sample
                                        was easily recruited despite the multi-device objective time-tracking requirements and no
                                        participants withdrew from the study due to this or other SM privacy invasive aspects [21].
                                        This suggests that SM privacy concerns among youth may have faded considerably since
                                        2013 and should encourage researchers to find cost-effective ways to objectively track SM
                                        platform time across adolescents’ electronic devices.
                                              Although supporting a shift toward objective SM time tracking methods, findings
                                        also carry implications for researchers limited to the use of self-report measures. That is, a
                                        greater understanding of the demographic, personality, and social identity characteristics
                                        systematically related to over-reporting SM time may help researchers for whom an objec-
                                        tive assessment is not possible to reduce or account for such reporting biases. For example,
                                        findings suggest that the accuracy of self-report is higher on SM platforms used less heavily
                                        (e.g., Facebook, Twitter). Thus, researchers limited to self-report may prefer to investigate
                                        time on these platforms. Alternatively, rather than ask multiple choice or free response
                                        questions about daily or weekly time on SM platforms prone to systematic reporting bias,
                                        it may be optimal for researchers limited by survey-based assessments to adopt validated,
                                        psychometrically sound scales to assess SM addiction or problematic SM use [49,50] in
                                        efforts to study correlates of excessive use. However, for survey researchers who need
                                        to assess daily time using a specific popular SM platform rather than SM addiction or
                                        problematic use, findings from this study suggest that it may be useful to query partici-
                                        pants about their time on various SM rather than only ask questions about the particular
                                        SM platform of interest. Although more research is needed, it may be possible to reduce
                                        reporting-related noise in relationships of interest in the analysis stage through advanced
                                        statistical techniques to the extent that associated participant-level data (i.e., sex, number of
                                        SM platforms used, and time on other SM platforms) is available.

                                        4.2. Limitations and Future Directions
                                              This study is limited in that data came from a sample of incoming first-year students
                                        from a single American university. However, the sample size exceeded those utilized
                                        in previous studies [15,18], and self-reported daily SM platform use patterns mapped
                                        onto national survey data from American 18–24-year-olds [32,49], suggesting that findings
                                        may generalize to older American adolescents beyond the current sample. However,
                                        it is unknown whether the similar patterns of daily use and systematic reporting biases
                                        generalize to younger adolescents or adolescents outside of the United States. An additional
                                        limitation was related to the RescueTime software application used in this study not
                                        being compatible with iPhones. This resulted in iPhone users being required to complete
                                        additional steps to ensure that the time they spent actively using the four SM platforms from
                                        their phones during the surveillance period could be combined with the data from their
                                        other electronic devices. To avoid such an extra burden among a subset of participants, it
                                        will be important for future research to develop and utilize cross-device software programs
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 9847                                                                               12 of 15




                                        able to track participants’ SM use more seamlessly across all versions of IOS, Android, and
                                        Windows-based operating systems.
                                              Another potential limitation is that participants’ awareness of the software installed
                                        on their electronic devices may have impacted their patterns of SM use to some unknown
                                        degree. However, data were collected within a larger multi-component project which
                                        likely worked against the potential for any such software impact. That is, participants
                                        were invited to take part in a 9-month study investigating the potential psychological
                                        impacts of what they see on SM during the transition into college. Informed consent
                                        information framed the collection of this study’s data in the context of the larger project’s
                                        broader research questions (e.g., “does seeing a lot of posts about partying or studying
                                        on SM influence your perceptions of how much college students really party or study?”).
                                        Although participants installed the tracking software and reported on their SM use in one
                                        of five surveys, in the service of the larger project they also provided their SM account
                                        logins so a bot could periodically sample the posts in their social media feeds, and were
                                        repeatedly surveyed about their normative perceptions, and completed multiple implicit
                                        association tests. Participants were also encouraged to use social media as usual during the
                                        study period and the research team’s secondary interest in their reporting accuracy was
                                        not disclosed. Although participants’ patterns of SM use and the discrepancies observed
                                        between objectively tracked and self-reported time seem unlikely to be an artifact of the
                                        time-tracking software or broader study participation, additional attention to this issue is
                                        warranted.
                                              A final limitation is that the study did not objectively assess participants’ time spent on
                                        every SM platform currently available (e.g., TikTok, YouTube, etc.), and instead narrowed
                                        its focus to the four platforms most widely used by American adolescents at the time
                                        of data collection and commonly studied in relation to well-being and health behavior
                                        outcomes. Although more research is needed, this study’s findings suggest that expanding
                                        focus to a larger number of popular SM platforms may lead to even greater reporting
                                        inaccuracies among adolescents swinging a greater number of platforms, with these inaccu-
                                        racies potentially further obscuring true relationships between time on SM, well-being, and
                                        health behavior. Thus, examining self-report inaccuracies on additional SM platforms and
                                        evaluating potential correlates such as culture, social identity, perceived in-group norms
                                        for platform use, and other SM variables (e.g., motivations for use, passive lurking versus
                                        active sharing or interaction) represent important directions for future research that may
                                        provide researchers investigating SM use among adolescents additional insight into survey
                                        question optimization and illuminate novel methods to reduce bias in self-report data.

                                        5. Conclusions
                                             Despite public health researchers’ tendency to assess adolescent social media behavior
                                        via self-report survey questions, findings from this study reveal that many adolescent
                                        participants are unable to accurately report the SM platforms they used over the previous
                                        2 weeks, and that, on average, adolescents also substantially over-estimate the average
                                        daily time they spend on individual SM platforms over this period of time. Further, the
                                        accuracy of adolescents’ responses to questions about average daily use appears to be
                                        systematically associated with the specific social media platforms in question, as well as the
                                        participant’s sex and the total number of social media platforms they use regularly, thereby
                                        biasing the results of survey-based studies investigating health-related correlates of SM
                                        use. As understanding adolescent patterns of SM use and psychosocial and behavioral
                                        correlates represent critical areas of inquiry that may inform the development of new public
                                        health intervention and prevention programs, the validity of social media assessments
                                        must improve.
