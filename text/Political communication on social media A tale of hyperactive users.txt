    Of course, the actual OSNs are trained online and have the ac-
tual posts users have interacted with or might interact with in the
future, as parameters. They also take as input thousands of features
we do not have access to. For example, they take into considera-
tion the pages a user has made a meaningful interaction, regard-
less of it is related to politics or not. They also include features
about the general popularity of content generated on the pages,
how much time a user spends on speciﬁc content, what informa-
tion they share on other services of the platforms, or what device
a user uses. All these pieces of information are not available to us,
and instead of speculating about their impact we leave them out
of our analysis. Nevertheless, we train recommendation algorithms
on the available data and illustrate the impact of hyperactive be-
haviour. Training models on topics as proxies of the actual posts
does not reduce the credibility of the study, as we want to make
inferences about the impact of the models on agenda-setting and
their accuracy on suggesting political content (H4,H5).
