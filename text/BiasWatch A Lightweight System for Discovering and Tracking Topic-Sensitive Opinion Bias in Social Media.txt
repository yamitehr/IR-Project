4.6 Multi-Category Classification
   In previous experiments, we mainly evaluate our framework as a
binary class problem. However, in this way, we lose the finer gran-
ularity of the inferred opinion bias score by ignoring users who are
neutral or do not show evidence. This category of users can not
only be beneficial to our understanding of the general landscape of
controversial topics, but also can be targeted by polarized activists
to influence their bias. Thus, in this section, we are interested in
a finer level of evaluation by casting it as a three-class problem.
Here, instead of combining the category +1 and +2, and the cate-
