      Expectations of journalists’ performance on
      social media and perceptions of media bias

      Twitter has become the leading social media platform for journalists to break news, build a follow-
      ing, and interact with the public. Social media offer journalists and citizens a communication space,
      where they can discuss issues, provide context for the news, and foster community values. This study
      examines how expectations about journalistic practices on social media inﬂuence audience
      engagement with journalists, and in turn, perceptions of editorial bias. Drawing on a two-wave
      panel survey from the United States, we ﬁrst ﬁnd that expectations about the practice of “good jour-
      nalism” on social media predict engagement with journalists on Twitter. Second, these personal
      interactions lead to lower levels of perceived bias in the news media. Finally, expectations of jour-
      nalists’ performance on social media are explored as a moderator of perceived editorial bias. This
      study adds to the growing literature analyzing the causes and outcomes of audience engagement
      with journalists on social media.

      Introduction
       The public mood toward the news media has reached an all-time nadir in the United
States. According to a recent Gallup Poll, less than half of Americans (40 percent) say that
they trust mass media to report the news fully, accurately, and fairly (Gallup 2015). Nearly
three-quarters (70 percent) of the population think that the news media intentionally bias
coverage (Paulsen 2015; Rasmussen 2015). Perceptions of media bias are troubling, since
they have been associated with a decrease in news consumption, and detachment from
public life (Cappella and Jamieson 1997; Jackob 2010; Pinkleton, Austin, and Fortman
1998; Tsfati and Cappella 2003). At the same time, many Americans, especially young
people, are getting their news online or through social media. About one-third of adults
get some news and public affairs information from Facebook or Twitter (Pew Research
Center 2015). These services offer a historically novel news environment, where users
can curate information ﬂows, and create their own content (Östman 2012; Wells and
Thorson 2015). The ability to comment, like, share, and follow news has led to increased
audience involvement with the news (Lotan et al. 2011; Thurman 2008). In turn, the very
boundaries of professional journalism are now debatable, as the nature of information dis-
tribution becomes a more ﬂuid, participatory exchange between citizens and the press
(Lewis 2012).

            In this changing news landscape, expectations about what constitutes good journal-
      ism are also changing (Gil de Zúñiga and Hinsley 2013). In particular, norms of interaction,
      reciprocity, and collaboration with the community are growing areas of interest (Borger,
      van Hoof, and Sanders 2014; Lewis 2015; Lewis, Holton, and Coddington 2014). These dis-
      cussions represent the potential shifting role of the journalist in democratic society.
      Although Twitter is a popular tool for journalists around the world, they rarely take full
      advantage of the interactive and collaboration capabilities of social media (Engesser and
      Humprecht 2015). One explanation is that journalists might be careful of appearing
      biased. However, scholars have yet to explore how interaction on Twitter might (or
      might not) lead to perceptions of media bias.
            This study builds on previous research that considers the potential for pro-social out-
      comes when journalists and citizens engage on social media (Borger, van Hoof, and Sanders
      2014; Holton et al. 2015). This study considers whether having expectations of good jour-
      nalism practices on social media might lead to increased engagement with journalists on
      Twitter, such as asking questions (via direct messages (DM) or @mention) or re-tweeting
      members of the media and citizen journalists. Second, we test whether having those expec-
      tations inﬂuences perceptions of editorial bias. Finally, this study also explores how citizens’
      engagement with journalists on Twitter might shape perceptions of editorial media bias.
      Drawing on survey panel data from the United States, we tested these relationships in
      regression models that include a full range of control variables, including: demographic
      information, trust in the media, political orientations, and overall news use. We ﬁnd that
      expectations of journalists’ use of social media for providing context, discussing issues,
      sharing news, and connecting to the community are directly related to re-tweeting news
      and asking questions via Twitter. In addition, we ﬁnd that the more individuals engage
      with journalists on Twitter, the less likely they are to perceive that the news media has
      an editorial bias. Finally, we tested for group differences (moderation effect) in levels of per-
      ceived bias between those with high and low expectations of journalists on social media.


            Twitter and the Shifting Professional Role of the Journalist
             Twitter is an ideal social networking platform to study the interaction of journalists
      and the public. The micro-blogging platform boasts 320 million users worldwide, and is
      a favorite reporting tool for journalists in the United States (Farhi 2009; Twitter 2015).
      The short, instant bits of communication text are used for breaking news, covering a
      beat, or linking back to the news organization’s website (Manjoo 2015; Parmelee 2013).
      Journalists are the largest group of veriﬁed users on Twitter (Mullin 2015). Twitter is also
      a popular way to get news and public affairs information. More Twitter users get news
      on the platform than any other social media site (Pew Research Center 2015). Micro-blog-
      ging also makes two-way communication between users rather effortless. It is not surpris-
      ing then, that one of the key appeals of Twitter is that it allows for collaboration between
      citizens and journalists (Hermida et al. 2012).
             The extent to which journalists are actually allowing citizens to participate in the
      news-making process is a point of open contention among professional journalists
      (Ekdale et al. 2015; Lewis 2012; Robinson 2011). This is because networked communication
      technologies, and especially social media, alter the traditional relationships between
      content producers and content consumers. In this environment, journalists may be hesitant
      to break with traditional reporting practices (Deuze 2007). Thinking of the audience as a
                              WHEN CITIZENS AND JOURNALISTS INTERACT ON TWITTER                       229

collaborator, instead of source or consumer, has been unevenly applied among news
workers. Journalists have reported being hesitant to engage in collaboration, or citizen jour-
nalism initiatives, because they feel that the quality of news would suffer in terms of accu-
racy and objectivity (Singer 2010). Interaction with audiences on Twitter is likely to be
based, at least in part, on the expectations of the news workers. Some evidence suggests
that journalists are less likely to support increased collaboration with the audience if they
view the practice as conﬂicting with their conception of “proper” reporting practices (Deuze
2007; Ekdale et al. 2015).
       On the other hand, content analyses of reporting practices on Twitter ﬁnd that tra-
ditional norms are being challenged in some cases. For example, one study analyzing pol-
itical reporters covering the 2012 presidential campaign found a high percentage of
personal opinion in tweets (Lawrence et al. 2014). Other studies found substantial use of
humor, opinion, and personal brand development work on Twitter (Holton and Lewis
2011; Molyneux 2015). However, in each of these cases authors argued that, overall, journal-
ists tend to avoid major deviations from traditional practices (Lasorsa, Lewis, and Holton
2012). This was particularly the case in terms of fact checking (deferring to authority)
and avoiding critique of presidential candidates (Coddington, Molyneux, and Lawrence
2014; Mourão, Diehl, and Vasudevan 2015). One common explanation across these
studies is that journalists take great care not to appear biased. They are willing to make
some concessions to the technology, but are ultimately still guided by rules of engagement
from the ofﬂine world.
       The growth of Twitter, and other networked communication technologies, coincides
with a steady decline in the newspaper industry over the last decade. Newsroom staff has
shrunk dramatically, readership is down, and revenues have fallen by more than half (Pew
Research Center 2015). Whether or not journalism can survive in this environment depends
on the extent to which newsrooms are able to adapt to new technologies (Ryfe 2012). In
this vein, at least one group of scholars suggests exploring the conditions under which
the audience successfully engage with journalists, as acts of sustained, direct, and indirect
reciprocity (Holton et al. 2015; Lewis 2015). According to this view, interacting with journal-
ists on social media leads to the expectation that, in turn, journalists will reciprocate with
quality content.


      Expectations of Performance and Engagement
       The conditions of journalistic engagement on social media are mostly clear: they are
reluctant to engage in social media if it challenges traditional roles, or gives the impression
of media bias. According to some scholars, journalists seem to expect that the news on
social media should look like the news ofﬂine (Deuze 2007; Domingo et al. 2008; Quandt
2008; Singer 2010). The conditions determining audience participation with the news are
rather different. Overall, individuals tend to participate in the news rarely, if at all (Bergström
2008; Larsson 2011). Instead, they use social media for personal purposes, to broadcast
themselves, express opinions, and engage in frivolous activity (Bergström 2008; Fröhlich,
Quiring, and Engesser 2012; Papacharissi 2007; Quan-Haase and Young 2010).
       When citizens do consume news on social media, it is often related to their
impressions about the credibility of the news, personal identiﬁcation with the source, or
for surveillance needs (Lee and Ma 2012; Turcotte et al. 2015; Zolkepli and Kamarulzaman
2015). These perspectives borrow from cognitive and social psychology, which postulates
230   HOMERO GIL DE ZÚÑIGA ET AL.

      that expectations are the precursors of behavioral outcomes (Bandura 2001; LaRose and
      Eastin 2004). As Van Dijck (2009) argues, the underlying mechanisms that drive individuals
      to share content in digital spaces is incredibly nuanced and complex. However, Borger, van
      Hoof, and Sanders (2014) identify a general pattern of engagement with the news media
      online through a series of experiments and interviews. The authors propose a model of par-
      ticipation with journalists based on ﬁve parts: inﬂuences, anticipation, participation, evalu-
      ation, and reconsideration. Participation (posting, sharing content, etc.) with the news is
      determined by expectations (anticipation) about the roles of the actors involved. Those
      expectations are informed by previous experiences, and personal images of the news
      organization or journalist (inﬂuences). After a participatory experience, individuals reﬂect
      (evaluation) on how the interaction met expectations, and then decide whether or not to
      continue participating (reconsideration). Put simply, expectations about the role of the jour-
      nalist in society drive participation in digital news environments, and accordingly, inﬂuence
      future interactions.
             Based on this rationale, those that follow the news on Twitter are likely to be inﬂu-
      enced by the basic norms of social media in general: social interaction, collaboration,
      two-way communication, and reciprocity (Benkler 2006; Lewis 2015; Van Dijck 2009).
      These inﬂuences alter expectations about the news—expectations that are shaped by
      their social media experiences (Lee and Ma 2012). In other words, for those that rely on
      social media for news, they might expect journalists to operate outside traditional roles.
      Journalists may be asked to directly engage in a discussion with the public, share news
      from other sources, or foster community values. In this context, expectations about how
      a journalist should behave will be shaped by the norms of digital culture. Following
      Borger, van Hoof, and Sanders (2014), these expectations will drive participatory behaviors.
      Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:
            H1: Expectations of journalists’ performance on social media (ﬁrst wave, W1) are positively
            associated with engagement with journalists on Twitter (second wave, W2).




            Expectations, Engagement, and Perceptions of Editorial Bias
            Bias in the news media has been widely discussed in political science and media
      studies.
            Scholars have debated the nature of framing, authority, political, and economic forms
      of news bias (e.g. Bennett 1996; Entman 1993; Hamilton 2004; Herman and Chomsky 2010;
      McCombs and Shaw 1972). Based on the sheer volume of research discussing the pressures
      that shape news content, it is hardly surprising that individuals may be inclined to adopt
      the perception that the news media are biased in some way. It is important to note that
      the extent to which bias does exist is a matter of debate (see Hamilton 2004). For the pur-
      poses of this article, bias is operationalized as a perception of the news media—one charac-
      terized by editorial bias toward: (1) the owner of the media organization; (2) the need to
      attract an audience; and (3) the tendency for news content to inﬂuence the viewer in
      some way. This deﬁnition is roughly equivalent to corporate and framing conceptions of
      news bias (Fico, Richardson, and Edwards 2004; Hamilton 2004; Mullainathan and Shleifer
      2005). This type of bias is particularly germane to the modern media environment, since
      many news organizations are facing increasing economic pressure.
                             WHEN CITIZENS AND JOURNALISTS INTERACT ON TWITTER                     231

        Public perceptions of bias in the news media can lead to political and media cynicism,
generally deﬁned as negative attitudes toward public private media institutions (Cappella
and Jamieson 1997; Kiousis 2001). Low evaluations of the news media are associated with a
decrease in news consumption, and increased preference for entertainment (Jackob 2010;
Tsfati and Cappella 2003). Decreased attention to public affairs is especially troubling, since
news consumption is considered the foundation of democratic citizenship, and is associ-
ated with a range of pro-social activities (Bennett 2008; Norris 2000; Paek, Yoon, and
Shah 2005; Schudson 1998).
        As hypothesized earlier, expectations about the role of journalists on social media
might inﬂuence engagement with journalists on Twitter. In addition, there is theoretical
and empirical evidence to suggest that expectations are also related to perceptions of
media bias. Scholarship in this area offers several explanations for the prevalence of per-
ceived media bias. These perceptions among the public have been explained as the
result of political partisanship, strength of ideology, elite discussions of the topic, and
the tendency for liberal-leaning journalists to over-compensate for their own bias
(Dalton, Beck, and Huckfeldt 1998; Gunther and Schmitt 2004; Hamilton 2004; Morris
2007; Watts et al. 1999). One rationale is that individuals form opinions about the news
based on “media schemata” (Kosicki and Mcleod 1990). Media schemata are internal
images, and include a range of beliefs and orientations toward the news media that
operate as guides, or expectations that inﬂuence how individuals process messages
(Chaffee 1990; McQuail 1987). Media schemata help explain attitudes of bias, because
they include normative expectations about the role of the press, and inﬂuence trust in
the news, perceptions of credibility, political fragmentation, and the view that journalists
serve themselves over their audience (Fredin, Kosicki, and Becker 1996; Watts et al.
1999). According to this literature, media schemata (however ﬂawed) result in perceptions
of bias when media content appears to conﬂict with, or conforms to, a pre-existing set of
schemata. Based on this literature, it is reasonable to suggest that expectations of journal-
ism performance on social media will be related to perceptions of media bias in some way.
        Empirical evidence suggests that normative expectations about the role of the press
in society are lofty ones, rooted in the idea of an adversarial press that holds public ofﬁcials
accountable to the public (Elliott and Schenck-Hamlin 1979; Schudson 1998). These norma-
tive expectations often coincide with negative views of actual press performance. This is
illustrated in the divergence between what people say journalists should do, versus what
people actually think of the press. For example, most Americans expect journalists to be
accurate, objective, act as a watch dog for the public, and cover stories that should be
covered (Gil de Zúñiga and Hinsley 2013; Heider, McCombs, and Poindexter 2005). The
irony here is that normative expectations set a standard for criteria that often conﬂicts
with internal media schemata. In other words, although the norms may be general stan-
dards, individuals still view the news as bias, because the content they come across con-
ﬂicts with a range of individual characteristics—like partisanship, ideology, or general
levels of trust in the news (Eveland and Shah 2003; Gunther and Schmitt 2004; Lee
2005). This conﬂict explains, at least in part, why public perceptions of media bias
remain so high. Therefore, if an individual holds high expectations about social media
press performance it is likely that they still view traditional media as failing to meet
these expectations.
        Expectations alone may be associated with perceptions of media bias. However, an
alternative explanation is that how individuals interact with media content will inﬂuence
232   HOMERO GIL DE ZÚÑIGA ET AL.

      their perceptions of bias. This is an area of increasing interest for scholars of online news
      media, since these technologies alter the nature of the news audiences in general (Lewis
      2012; Robinson 2011). For example, some scholars note that there is a difference
      between consumptive and expressive behaviors online (Gil de Zúñiga et al. 2013;
      Pingree 2007). According to this literature, those who passively consume media in a
      digital environment are less likely to reap the rewards of increased interpersonal inter-
      action. One reason for this is that, without expressive and communicative engagement,
      individuals do not do the cognitive work of reﬂection and re-evaluation necessary for learn-
      ing from news media (Gil de Zúñiga 2006; Pingree 2007). When individuals share infor-
      mation in networked spaces, information exchanges over time help build trust, and lead
      to more sharing over time (Hsu et al. 2007). Thus, without engaging in reciprocal behaviors,
      expectations alone might not lead to changes in levels of perceived bias, because they are
      unable to build trust and learn from the media.
             There is further reason to propose that expectations alone will be associated with
      higher levels of perceived media bias. Those with high expectations of journalism perform-
      ance on Twitter may also be critical of the news media in general, because their expec-
      tations of performance are set by experiences with alternative habits of media
      consumption (in this case, social media). If the news media are expected to conform to stan-
      dards set in social media spaces, and an individual does not interact with journalists on
      Twitter, it is likely that they will evaluate mainstream news in general as bias. This rationale,
      in combination with the above theoretical and empirical evidence around media schemata,
      leads to the following hypothesis:
            H2: Expectations of journalists’ performance on social media (W1) are associated with
            higher perceptions of editorial media bias (W2).

             We expected the above relationship with perceived media bias to be different when
      one participates in the news environment on Twitter. On Twitter, individuals can share
      news, directly ask journalists questions in real time, follow a conversation around the
      news, and see details about the journalist (Hermida 2010; Hermida et al. 2012; Lasorsa,
      Lewis, and Holton 2014). These interactions involve a higher level of closeness and personal
      acquaintance when compared to the traditional, ofﬂine relationship between journalists
      and their audience. Instant, inter-personal interactions with the news, and news workers,
      are a unique product of social media. When individuals share inter-personal experiences
      on social networks, they also receive pro-social, learning beneﬁts from interactions on
      the network (Borger, van Hoof, and Sanders 2014; Gil de Zúñiga et al. 2013; Hsu et al.
      2007; Pingree 2007). Personal experience with journalists, and experiences of reciprocity
      with the news, might lead to lower levels of perceived media bias. As outlined above, jour-
      nalists are reluctant to use social media in any way that violates long-standing conceptions
      of proper reporting: objectivity, accuracy, and quality (e.g. Deuze 2007; Singer 2010). It
      stands to reason then, that the more one directly interacts with journalists on Twitter,
      the more likely it is that one will learn about how journalists do their job. In addition,
      drawing on research on the cognitive beneﬁts of interaction on social media (Borger,
      van Hoof, and Sanders 2014; Hsu et al. 2007), any positive experience with a journalist
      on Twitter is likely to lead to a re-evaluation of the role of journalists in society (through
      evaluation and reconsideration). This re-evaluation will force an individual to reconcile
      their experience with prior expectations of performance. Thus, those that previously had
      media bias concerns would learn from interactions on Twitter. In contrast, those individuals
                            WHEN CITIZENS AND JOURNALISTS INTERACT ON TWITTER                    233

pre-disposed to engagement on social media would have their positive expectations re-
enforced. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:
      H3: Engagement with journalists on Twitter (W1) is associated with lower perceptions of
      editorial media bias (W2).
       Finally, how might expectations and engagement interact to reduce, or increase,
levels of perceived media bias? It is possible that those with low expectations of perform-
ance might be inﬂuenced by their experiences with journalists on Twitter more than others.
Since the key objective of this study is to test the relationship between interaction with
journalists on Twitter and perceptions of media bias, while also exploring the potential
group differences in this relationship between those with higher and lower expectations
of press performance on social media, we propose the following research question:
      RQ1: Do expectations of journalists’ performance on social media (W1) moderate the
      effect of engagement with journalists on Twitter (W1) on perceptions of editorial media
      bias (W2)?


      Methods
      Sample
       To test these hypotheses, a two-wave online panel survey was conducted over the
course of three months in the United States. The questionnaire was developed by a
Research Unit at a level 1 Research University in the United States, and administered by
the media-polling group Nielsen. The sample was constructed from over 200,000 people
previously registered with Nielsen, applying a stratiﬁed quota sampling method based
on demographics for an accurate representation of the US census. The study was con-
ducted using the Web survey software Qualtrics.
       A total of 2060 participants, from an initial sample of 5000 individuals, completed the
ﬁrst wave from December 15, 2013 to January 5, 2014. Only 1813 of these observations
were retained, as 247 participants had to be excluded due to incomplete or invalid data.
From February, 15 to March 5, 2014, 1024 participants completed the second wave of
the survey. The response rate for the ﬁrst wave was 34.6 percent, while the retention
rate for the second wave was 57 percent. Both response rate ﬁgures fall within acceptable
parameters for data integrity for online panel surveys (Bosnjak, Das, and Lynn 2016; Watson
and Wooden 2006). The sample demographics are similar to the US census, although
slightly older, better educated, and with fewer Hispanics (see below).


      Independent and Dependent Variables
       This study had two main objectives. First, we wanted to examine the inﬂuence of
expectations about journalists’ performance on social media on (1) the likelihood of estab-
lishing closer relationships with journalists via engagement on Twitter, and (2) perceptions
regarding editorial bias in media coverage. Second, we also assessed the effects of enga-
ging with journalists on Twitter on perceptions of editorial bias. Thus, our models
include engagement with journalists on Twitter, both as a dependent and independent
variable, while perceived media bias is always analyzed as a dependent variable. Accord-

      variables. All items are 10-point Likert scale, unless otherwise noted (1 = strongly disagree,
      10 = strongly agree).

            Perceived editorial media bias. To measure perceptions of media bias, respondents
      were asked to rate their level of agreement with the following statements: “news compa-
      nies choose stories based on what will attract the biggest audience,” “production tech-
      niques can be used to inﬂuence a viewer’s perception,” and “the owner of a media
      company inﬂuences the content that is produced” (W2 Cronbach’s α = 0.91, mean = 7.87,
      SD = 2.26).

            Expectations about journalists on social media. This variable comprises personal expec-
      tations about the positive role journalists can play on social media, through fostering con-
      versation and contextualizing current events. Expectations about journalists’ performance
      on social media were measured with six items. Respondents were asked how much they
      expected journalists on social media to “give interpretations/analysis of the news,”
      “discuss news events with other users,” “share news from other sources,” “connect commu-
      nity members to each other,” “encourage conversation about solving community pro-
      blems,” and “foster community values” (W1 Cronbach’s α = 0.97; mean = 2.91, SD = 2.34;
      W2 Cronbach’s α = 0.97; mean = 2.94, SD = 2.38).

            Engaging with journalists on Twitter. This variable measures the degree to which indi-
      viduals engage in an active online relationship with journalists. Respondents were asked
      how often they “retweet a member of the news media,” “retweet citizen journalists,” “ask
      questions (via DM or @mention) to a member of the news media,” and “ask questions
      (via DM or @mention) to a citizen journalist” (four-item averaged scale; W1 Cronbach’s
      α = 0.97; mean = 1.49, SD = 1.56; W2 Cronbach’s α = 0.97; mean = 1.62, SD = 1.60).


            Control Variables
            In order to control for potential confounds, our statistical models also include a
      variety of variables that may explain relationships between the variables of interest. The
      ﬁrst set of controls includes socio-demographic variables: age (mean = 52.71, SD = 14.72),
      gender (49.70 percent females), education (highest level of education completed, range =
      1–8; mean = 3.61, median = some college), income (total annual household income,
      range = 1–8; mean = 4.46, median = $50,000–$59,999), and race (77.9 percent white). A
      second set of variables included political orientations: political interest, political knowledge,
      discussion network size, and discussion frequency. Finally, two more variables controlled for
      the effect of trust in traditional and alternative news media.

            Political interest. This composite variable captures respondents’ degree of interest in
      “information about what’s going on in politics and public affairs,” as well as their level of
      attention to “information about what’s going on in politics and public affairs” (two-items
      averaged scale, W1 Spearman–Brown = 0.97; mean = 6.67, SD = 2.70).

            Political knowledge. This study also controls for the effect of individuals’ awareness of
      current events and knowledge about the overall functioning of the political system. Correct
      responses were coded as 1, while incorrect or missing ones were coded as 0. The authors
                              WHEN CITIZENS AND JOURNALISTS INTERACT ON TWITTER                  235

created items based on recommendations by Delli Carpini and Keeter (1997) (eight-item
additive scales, range = 0–8, W1 Kuder–Richardson 20 (KR20) = 0.75; mean = 4.58, SD =
2.17).

      Discussion network size. We also controlled for the approximate number of people
that make up a respondent’s discussion network, as this variable has been previously
related to political attitudes and behaviors, including news use (Mutz 2002). We asked
respondents in an open-ended fashion about the number of people they “talked to face-
to-face or over the phone about politics or public affairs,” and “talked to via the internet,
including e-mail, chat rooms and social networking sites about politics or public affairs,”
during the past month. As expected, the additive scale consisting of these two items
was highly skewed (W1 mean = 4.36, median = 1.00, SD = 16.89, skewness = 10.86). The
natural logarithm was then used to convert the distribution of a variable to a more
normal distribution (W1 mean = 0.33, median = 0.24, SD = 0.37, skewness = 1.32).

      Discussion frequency.  Respondents were also asked about the frequency of political
talk with both near and far people. The questionnaire asked how often respondents talk
about politics or public affairs with: “spouse or partner,” “family and relatives,” “friends,”
“acquaintances,” “strangers,” “neighbors you know well,” “co-workers you know well,”
and “co-workers you do not know well (10-item averaged scale, W1 Cronbach’s α = 0.87;
mean = 3.27, SD = 1.74).

      Traditional media trust. This variable taps the level of conﬁdence and trust subjects
report concerning traditional news media. Thus, the questionnaire asked respondents
how much they trusted news from “mainstream news media” and “news aggregators”
(two-item index, W1 Spearman–Brown = 0.50; mean = 5.00, SD = 1.95).

     Alternative media trust. In order to provide a more comprehensive measure of trust in
the media, we also considered individual’s trust in non-mainstream, alternative news
media. Respondents were asked about their level of trust in news from “alternative news
media (e.g., blogs, citizen journalism),” and “social media sites” (two-item index, W1 Spear-
man–Brown = 0.70; mean = 3.56, SD = 1.98).

       Traditional news media use. Respondents were asked several questions to tap fre-
quency of exposure to news from local television news, cable, national and local newspa-
pers, and radio news (nine-item averaged scale, W1 Cronbach’s α = 0.76; mean = 5.26, SD =
1.85).

      Social media for news. Respondents were asked questions related to news consump-
tion on social media, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, Instagram, Tumblr,
and Reddit (seven-item averaged scale, W1 Cronbach’s α = 0.87; mean = 1.73, SD = 1.75).

     Overall social media use. Since individuals use social media for a range of activities
beyond news (Quan-Haase and Young 2010), three items were included related to
general social media use for social and connective purposes. The items asked how often
respondents use social media “to stay in touch with friends and family,” “to meet new
236   HOMERO GIL DE ZÚÑIGA ET AL.

      people who share interests,” and “On a typical day, how much do you use social media”
      (three-item averaged scale, W1 Cronbach’s α = 0.75; mean = 3.63, SD = 2.29).


            Statistical Analyses
             In the light of our hypotheses and research question, we conducted a series of lagged
      panel regression analyses. First, we conducted a time-lagged ordinary least-square
      regression (OLS) to assess the predictors of expectations about journalists on social
      media. Next, we ran a model where expectations about journalists on social media is
      regressed on engaging with journalists on Twitter in time. In the model, the independent
      variables (taken from W1) were introduced in different blocks. The ﬁrst block of variables
      comprised the set of demographics, the second included sociopolitical antecedents, and
      the third contained variables related to media antecedents (trust in traditional media,
      trust in alternative media, traditional news use, social media for news, and overall social
      media use). The fourth block comprised just our variable of interest: expectations of journal-
      ists on social media. Second, we conducted a series of time-lagged OLS regressions to
      explore the effect of our variables of interest on editorial media bias perceptions (the
      ﬁrst model to assess the direct effects and the second to test the interaction effect). The
      ﬁrst three blocks of variables were identical to the above-mentioned, while the fourth
      included expectations of journalists on social media, and the interaction term (expectations
      of journalists on social media × engagement with journalist on Twitter). Finally, to plot the
      interaction effect, we used the PROCESS macro in SPSS (Hayes 2013; Model 1; Figure 1).


            Results
             The ﬁrst hypothesis (H1) proposed that expectations of performance are positively
      related to engaging with journalists on Twitter at a later time. Table 1 shows that, consistent
      with H1, expectations for journalists’ performance on social media (W1) is positively and
      strongly associated with engaging with journalists on Twitter (W2) (β = 0.224, p < 0.001).
      Younger adults (β = −0.140, p < 0.001), men (β = −0.066, p < 0.01), those who discuss poli-
      tics (β = 0.117, p < .001), and those that rely on social media for news (β = 0.352, p <
      0.001) were also likely to say that they engaged with journalists on Twitter. Table 1 also

shows the individual factors related to expectations of performance on social media.
Younger people, those that discuss politics more frequently, those with higher levels of
trust in alternative news sources, and those who use social media for non-news also
expected journalists to give context to the news, share content, and foster community dis-
cussions on social media. These ﬁndings are in line with the central thesis of the paper,
which proposes that social media experiences set standards for a type of reciprocity
between journalists and their audiences. H1 is supported.
       H2 predicted that expectations about journalists on social media are positively associ-
ated with perceptions of media bias. According to the second series of lagged OLS models
and consistent with H2, expectations of journalists’ performance on social media are
directly related to perceptions of editorial media bias, and the relationship is positive
and statistically signiﬁcant (β = 0.113, p < 0.001) (Model 1; Table 2). Older adults (β =
0.108, p < 0.001), females (β = 0.073, p < 0.05), whites (β = 0.091, p < 0.01), and those with
higher levels of political knowledge (β = 0.189, p < 0.001) were more likely to report
holding perceptions of media bias. H2 is conﬁrmed. Our third hypothesis stated a direct,
negative effect of asking journalists questions and re-tweeting content via Twitter on per-
ceptions of media bias (H3). Consistent with H3 (Model 1; Table 2), engaging with journalists

      on Twitter lowers an individual’s perception of media bias (β = −0.128, p < 0.001). Those
      more engaged with journalists on Twitter tend to perceive the news media in general as
      less biased. H3 is conﬁrmed.
             Finally, our research question explored a possible interaction effect of expectations
      and engagement on perceptions of media bias. Table 2 shows a positive, statistically signiﬁ-
      cant interaction effect (β = 0.282, p < 0.05) (Model 2; Table 2). Overall, a closer relationship
      with journalists on Twitter is associated with lower levels of perceived media bias. However,
      concerning the inﬂuence of the moderating variable, this positive effect is less intense
      among those with high expectations regarding the role of journalists on social media.
      Put differently, those who report higher levels of engagement with journalists on Twitter,
      and have lower expectations about their role on social media, tend to beneﬁt more from
      their Twitter interactions, at least in regards to altering their perceptions of overall media
      bias (Figures 1 and 2).

      Discussion
      Public evaluations of press performance (including media bias) are at all-time lows
(Gallup 2015; Paulsen 2015; Rasmussen 2015). Interacting in social media spheres is one
possible way to meliorate the situation, through sustained engagement with the public
on micro-blogging platforms like Twitter (Lewis 2015). This study explored how expec-
tations of good journalism on social media (giving analysis of the news, discussing
events, sharing news from other sources, fostering community values, etc.) lead to audience
engagement with journalists on Twitter, and in turn, lower levels of perceived media bias.
Citizens’ perceptions of proper journalism practice on social media include a range of activi-
ties associated with reciprocity, collaboration, and public service. The news industry is
struggling on two fronts: contests over the role of journalism in networked information
spaces, and increasing economic pressures (Lewis 2012; Ryfe 2012). Fulﬁlling citizens’
expectations of “good journalism” practice on social media is one way to maintain pro-
fessional integrity, and engage news audiences.



      Engagement and Editorial Bias
      Our models indicate that expectations of performance on social media are a strong
predictor that one will engage with journalists on Twitter. However, in order for individuals
to lower their levels of perceived editorial bias, they had to engage with the news on
Twitter. That is, those with high expectations alone were also more likely to report
seeing an editorial bias in the news. The results indicate that individuals who do not interact
online are not experiencing the potential pro-social beneﬁts of social media (Bond et al.
2012; Pingree 2007). This is in line with previous studies outlining the differential effects
between consumptive and expressive media uses (Gil de Zúñiga and Rojas 2009; Gil de
Zúñiga et al. 2013).
240   HOMERO GIL DE ZÚÑIGA ET AL.

             Although we expected that engagement would lower perceptions of editorial bias,
      the result is also somewhat counter-intuitive. Several studies show that the traditional con-
      ception of the “objective” reporter does not apply on Twitter. On this particular social media
      platform, journalists share opinions, engage in humor, and discuss “job talk” with the public
      (Lawrence et al. 2014; Molyneux 2015). If this is the case, one might argue that increased
      interaction with journalists on Twitter would increase perceptions of bias. That is, certain
      violations of professional objectivity might further stimulate notions of a bias press
      corps. However, journalists only partially abandon traditional reporting norms on Twitter.
      In fact, evidence in this area suggests that reporters on Twitter still strongly defer to auth-
      ority, rarely criticize politicians, and often act more like stenographers than fact checkers
      (Coddington, Molyneux, and Lawrence 2014; Lasorsa, Lewis, and Holton 2012; Mourão,
      Diehl, and Vasudevan 2015). Other scholars point out that journalists are hesitant to relin-
      quish control over the news, and often attach traditional norms to their digital work (e.g.
      Quandt 2008; Singer 2010). We expect that perceptions of bias decrease, because individ-
      uals are experiencing, at least in part, these more traditional values of reporting. In
      response, the social interaction on Twitter stimulates long-held assumptions about the
      “objective” reporter.


            Interaction Effect
             Expectations of “good journalism” practices in social media matter when explaining
      effects on an individual’s level of perceived editorial bias. In other words, the more people
      engage with journalists on Twitter, the less likely they are to report viewing the media as
      having an editorial bias. However, the effect is stronger for those with lower expectations.
      Those with low expectations of journalists’ performance on social media beneﬁt the most
      from increased engagement. This may be because these individuals are learning more
      about the intentions of the individual journalist, the processes of reporting, and the poten-
      tial social utility of journalism on social media. In turn, these individuals are less likely to
      view the overall news media as biased, because they derived some positive sense of the
      role of the news in society. Those with higher expectations also tend to perceive the
      media as less biased when they engage with the news on Twitter, compared to those
      with high expectations who do not engage on Twitter. However, they do not seem to be
      lowering their perceptions of editorial bias to the same extent as respondents with lower
      expectations. This may be happening because those with higher expectations tend to
      learn less from their Twitter experiences. They may also hold journalists, and the news
      media in general, to higher normative standards that are difﬁcult to meet in reality.
             Overall, these results suggest that when expectations of journalistic performance are
      in line with the ethos of digital culture, respondents tend to see bias in mainstream media.
      However, these positive expectations also lead respondents to engage more frequently
      with journalists on social media. That social interaction seems to be strengthening positive
      perceptions of the press. These relationships hold, after including a range of demographic
      and personal traits. However, it is interesting to note who tends to engage with the emer-
      ging digital news culture. According to the results, it is younger men, with higher levels of
      trust in alternative news sources. Future studies might investigate whether, and why, a
      gender gap might exist for these behaviors (Gil de Zúñiga and Valenzuela 2010).
             This study has some important limitations that should be mentioned. First, this study
      looked at Twitter speciﬁcally. Future work should investigate the effects of interactions on
                             WHEN CITIZENS AND JOURNALISTS INTERACT ON TWITTER                      241

other social media platforms. We also do not have pre-engagement and post-engagement
measures for editorial bias. Future research in this area might experiment with the various
types of social media activities, and with different types of news content, to better deter-
mine when and why engagement might have positive social outcomes. Thus, more work
needs to be done to determine the underlying causes for how social interaction leads to
improved perceptions about media bias. The number of individuals who use Twitter for
news is still relatively small, so results should be interpreted with caution for generalizing
to other contexts of interaction with journalists.
       The ﬁndings offer valuable evidence for an argument that encourages newsrooms to
take advantage of the collaborative and networking capabilities of Twitter. Much of the lit-
erature on professional practice on Twitter suggests that journalists refrain from certain
types of engagement with the public, perhaps out of fear of being viewed as bias in some
way (e.g. Engesser and Humprecht 2015). Results from the regression models suggest that
the opposite is true. The more individuals interact with journalists on Twitter, perceptions
of editorial bias decrease. This result offers empirical support for researchers and pro-
fessionals who are encouraging journalists to re-think their role in democratic society. As
newsrooms shrink and economic pressures continue to squeeze the industry, reporters
will come under increasing pressure to maintain a public service role. In the case of social
media, reciprocity with citizens and collaborative news making is one solution (Borger,
van Hoof, and Sanders 2014; Holton et al. 2015; Lewis 2012; Lewis et al. 2014).
       As long as journalists resist technological changes that conﬂict with a preferred (often
pre-internet era) conception of their role in society, engagement with the audience will
likely be limited in some areas (control over content, collaborative news making).
However, by living up to expectations of good practices on social media, journalists and
citizens will both beneﬁt. In short, “good journalism” and how both citizens and journalists
perceive journalistic practices matter (Gil de Zúñiga and Hinsley 2013). Increased citizen
engagement means higher likelihood of reaching a larger audience, while at the same
time increasing trafﬁc to news websites. For citizens, the increased exposure to individual
journalists may alter orientations toward the media, thus increasing their news consump-
tion. This could lead to greater involvement in public life through social media, particularly
for younger citizens.
