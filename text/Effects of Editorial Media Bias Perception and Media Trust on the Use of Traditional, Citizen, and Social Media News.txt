                                                      Abstract
                                                      Citizens’ levels of mistrust toward the media, as well as their perception of media
                                                      bias, have increased in past years in most Western democracies. This study explores
                                                      how these negative observations on journalism may influence their use of traditional,
                                                      citizen, and social media for news. Drawing on two-wave U.S. panel data, results
                                                      suggest that media trust and perceived bias relate to media consumption differently.
                                                      Trust in social and citizen media positively predicts use of news via social media, but
                                                      has no effect on traditional or citizen news use. By contrast, perceived media bias is
                                                      associated with decreased news use overall.

                                                      Journalism and the news media play key roles for the proper functioning of modern
                                                      democratic societies (Brundidge, Garret, Rojas, & Gil de Zúñiga, 2014). Not without
                                                      reason, journalism is considered to be the life-blood of a democracy, as it enables
                                                      informed, reasoned, and rational participation by citizens (Gil de Zúñiga, 2015; Gunther,

                                                      watchdog that oversees the activities of public authorities on behalf of citizens, and also

as a mediator between citizens and politicians (Dyck & Zingales, 2002; Serrin & Serrin,
2002). This ideal model is based on the trust placed by people in journalists, who are
expected to put aside their political views and create unbiased news stories in accor-
dance with the principles of “objectivity,” “fairness,” and “clear separation of informa-
tion and opinion” (Farnsworth & Lichter, 2007; Schudson, 1978).
   However, this prevalent narrative about the role of journalism in democratic societ-
ies is currently changing due to (a) the rise of the internet, online news technologies,
social media tools, and mobile applications, and (b) a crisis in traditional media (Garret
et al., 2012). Citizen journalism has, to some extent, challenged the hierarchical, uni-
directional model of news due to the fact that now ordinary citizens also engage in
journalistic practices (Goode, 2009; Kenix, 2008). In the United States, but also in
most of Western democracies, this changing media landscape may also be fueled by
the public’s growing distrust toward the media, as well as their concern about the per-
vasiveness of biased reporting (Iyengar & Hahn, 2009; Jones, 2004; Morris, 2007;
Watts, Domke, Shah, & Fan, 1999). These negative perceptions have shown to reduce
traditional media use, as people tend to obtain information from media they trust and
to avoid those ones they distrust (Gaziano, 1988; Kiousis, 2001; Lupia & McCubbins,
1998). Most previous studies, however, have mainly focused their attention on the
effects of trust in mainstream news media (e.g., Bennett, Rhine, Flickinger, & Bennett,
1999; Jackob, 2010; Tsfati, 2010; Tsfati & Cappella, 2003), while the outcomes of
trust in citizen or alternative media are still virtually unexplored. More specifically,
previous research has not determined whether trust in non-mainstream media drive
news consumption either in similar or different ways than trust in traditional media
does. A similar gap in the literature exists regarding the possible effects of media bias
perception on citizen journalism exposure.
   This study takes a step toward that direction and sheds light over these important,
unresolved questions. First, the article seeks to examine the effect of trust in the media
and perceived bias on patterns of news use. Additionally, the potentially different
influences of trust in traditional media versus trust in social and citizen media are
explored. To do so, we use data from a two-wave panel survey of a national sample of
U.S. adults, which is more appropriate than cross-sectional data to establish evidence
of causal relationships.


Traditional, Citizen, and Social Media Use for News
In the recent past, the unidirectional flow of information from news media organiza-
tions to audience members left little room for participation in the creation or dispersal
of information about politics or public affairs. This picture has gradually changed due
to the widespread use of the internet and social media, providing citizens with new
opportunities to actively engage in the process of information production (Bachmann,
Correa, & Gil de Zúñiga, 2012; Chadha, Avila, & Gil de Zúñiga, 2012). They are citi-
zen journalists (Carpenter, 2010; Goode, 2009; Thurman, 2008). The term citizen
journalism can be used in a restrictive way, and applied only to the creation of original
news content (interviewing, reporting, or analyzing news events). In a more open,
Ardèvol-Abreu and Gil de Zúñiga                                                     705


inclusive definition, citizen journalism may also include forms of collaboration in the
news process in which no new material is created (e.g., linking, commenting on the
posts created by others, retweeting, re-posting, etc.; Goode, 2009; Nip, 2006).
    Citizen journalism and user-generated content are contributing to the development
of what has been termed the “Fifth Estate,” complementary of the traditional “Fourth
Estate” (the mass media; Dutton & Eynon, 2009). The “Fifth Estate” is an emergent,
non-physical institution built on “networked individuals” with the ability to access and
share information from a variety of alternative sources, thereby opening “new ways of
increasing the accountability of politicians, press, experts and other loci of power”
(Dutton, 2009, p. 2). Based on their common role as disseminators of information
about politics and public events, the Fourth and Fifth Estates have begun to create
links between each other that have somewhat changed the patterns of news production
and use (Newman, Dutton, & Blank, 2012). In the words of Richard Sambrook, former
BBC’s Head of News, “from now on news coverage is a partnership [between the
media and the public]” (cited by Newman et al., 2012).
    However, while professional and citizen journalism influence each other, a growing
body of literature has also found profound differences in the contents they produce
(Carpenter, 2010) and their impact on the audience (Carr, Barnidge, Lee, & Tsang,
2014; Kaufhold, Valenzuela, & Gil de Zúñiga, 2010). Thus, for example, citizen-gen-
erated content typically focuses on news coverage of a limited geographic area or a
specific topic overlooked by mainstream media (Metzgar, Kurpius, & Rowley, 2011).
Other studies have also shown that the public perceives the roles of both professional
and citizen journalists as different (Nah & Chung, 2012). For these reasons, it makes
sense to study whether media trust and perceived media bias relate to traditional and
citizen media use differently or not.
    The symbiotic relationship between traditional and citizen news is taking place
primarily in the social media arena. On the one hand, increasing proportions of the
traffic to online mainstream media is referred from Facebook or Twitter by ordinary
citizens who filter, comment, and/or adapt the media content (Holton, Coddington, &
Gil de Zúñiga, 2013; Newman et al., 2012). On the other, professional journalists are
engaging more and more in active online active relationships with their audience,
which often leads the former to give credit to content created by the latter (via men-
tion, retweet, share, link, etc.; Hermida, Lewis, & Zamith, 2014). Hence, social media
can be a source for mainstream and citizen-created news, but also for hybrid informa-
tion containing the attributes of both. This is why this study separately considers the
effects of trust in the media and media bias perception on (a) traditional news use, (b)
citizen news use, and (c) social media use for news.

Trust in the Media and Media Use
Modern societies operate through social division of work and specialization that make
it difficult or impossible for individuals to make decisions in all areas of their lives
(Luhmann, 1979). In the political domain, journalists and media are entrusted with
assisting citizens in becoming informed to make meaningful political decisions. Given
706                                   Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly 94(3)


that it is almost impossible for citizens to get a firsthand experience of major political
and social issues of the country, a certain degree of trust in the media is necessary to
ensure the proper functioning of the democratic process (Bennett et al., 1999; Tsfati &
Cohen, 2005). The opposite of media trust is media distrust, related to “the feeling that
journalists are not fair or objective in their reports about society and that they do not
always tell the whole story” (Tsfati, 2003, p. 159).
    Given the important links between media and democracy, political science and com-
munication scholars have paid attention to the overall decline in trust in the media over
the last decades. Most of these studies however are limited to Western democracies
(Müller, 2013). In the U.S. context, for example, confidence in the press has fallen
sharply from a 28.3% in 1976 to an 8.8% in 2012, with a slightly higher decline for press
than for TV (Smith & Son, 2013, p. 2). While a long tradition in media research has
explored the related concept of media credibility1 (e.g., Hovland, Janis, & Kelley, 1953;
Kohring & Matthes, 2007; Westley & Severin, 1964) and the reasons behind the decline
of trust in the media (e.g. Cappella & Jamieson, 1997), only a few studies have focused
on the consequences of media (dis)trust (Carr et al., 2014; Tsfati & Cappella, 2003).
    In this line of research, communication scholars have found a mild association
between (dis)trust in mainstream media and media exposure patterns (Kiousis, 2001;
Tsfati, 2010; Tsfati & Cappella, 2003, 2005; Wanta & Hu, 1994). Because the current
media environment is characterized by the availability of multiple sources of informa-
tion, it makes sense to assume—and, in fact, this has been found to be the case—that
people tend to seek accurate information from sources they consider reliable and to
avoid the exposure to sources they distrust (Gaziano, 1988; Kiousis, 2001; Tsfati &
Cappella, 2003). Therefore, people who trust in mainstream media tend to consume
more news from mainstream sources. Conversely, traditional media skeptics tend to
consume less mainstream news and to have more non-mainstream media news as a
part of their “media diet” (Carr et al., 2014; Jackob, 2010; Tsfati, 2010; Tsfati &
Cappella, 2003). This effect, however, has been found to be “only modest, although
statistically significant” (Tsfati & Cappella, 2005, p. 252). Based on these findings and
theoretical considerations, the first set of hypotheses are proposed:

   H1: Trust in traditional media at Wave 1 is positively related to traditional news use
   at Wave 2.
   H2: Trust in traditional news media at Wave 1 is negatively related to citizen news
   use at Wave 2. In other words, mistrust toward traditional news media at Wave 1
   predicts citizen news use at Wave 2.

   Recent studies on the relationship between trust and online media use have found
that skepticism toward mainstream media is negatively related to overall online news
exposure. However, once the effects on mainstream and non-mainstream online media
are disaggregated, media trust behaves in the same way as it does offline: Those who
trust in the mainstream media tend to show higher levels of exposure to mainstream
online news, while media skeptics tend to visit more non-mainstream sites (Tsfati,
2010), which they find more credible (Carr et al., 2014). Despite these previous
Ardèvol-Abreu and Gil de Zúñiga                                                       707


findings in the online domain, the influence of trust in traditional media on social
media use for news seems difficult to predict. As discussed above, social media pro-
vide almost simultaneous access to both traditional and citizen news. Consequently,
the first research question is as follows:

   RQ1: What is the effect (if any) of trust in traditional media at Wave 1 on social
   media use for news at Wave 2?

    Although the pattern of influence from media trust to media consumption has been
confirmed by empirical evidence, previous research has mostly paid attention to “tra-
ditional” or “mainstream” media trust (e.g., Jones, 2004; Miller & Krosnick, 2000;
Tsfati & Cappella, 2003). Based on the above-mentioned impact of trust in main-
stream media on news use, one could expect a complementary effect from trust in
social and citizen media. Therefore, trust in citizen and social media should be posi-
tively related to citizen and social media use for news, but negatively related to tradi-
tional media use. However, the effect might also be different, as some studies have
found that trust in professional and citizen news media are correlated: Those who trust
in professional journalism also tend to trust citizen journalism, and vice versa
(Kaufhold et al., 2010). Considering such a complex picture and the absence of previ-
ous studies looking at the role of trust in citizen and social media as antecedents of
media exposure, the following set of research questions are addressed in the study:

   RQ2: What is the effect (if any) of trust in citizen and social media at Wave 1 on
   traditional news use at Wave 2?
   RQ3: What is the effect (if any) of trust in citizen and social media at Wave 1 on
   citizen news use at Wave 2?
   RQ4: What is the effect (if any) of trust in citizen and social media at Wave 1 on
   social media use for news at Wave 2?


Media Objectivity, Bias Perception, and Media Exposure
Over the past decades, public concern regarding the pervasiveness of biased reporting
in the U.S. news media has steadily increased (Iyengar & Hahn, 2009; Morris, 2007;
Watts et al., 1999). In 2012, 37% of Americans said that there is a “great deal” of bias
in news coverage, while 30% more believed that there was “a fair amount” of bias
(Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 2012). All these allegations and
perceptions have drawn the attention of a number of scholars, who have tried to deter-
mine whether (a) news media contravene the standards of professional journalism by
presenting political issues and news events in an unbalanced manner, (b) there are
perceptive and evaluative psychological phenomena that explain the media bias per-
ception beyond the news content itself, and (c) there is a link between media bias
perception and media exposure.
    The concept of media bias is elusive in nature, and lacks a universal definition. Bias
has often been defined in a negative way, on the basis of the ingredients that make a
708                                     Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly 94(3)


news story free of it. Unbiased news have been considered as a function of reporters’
“objectivity,” “fairness,” and ability to clearly “separate information and opinion,” all
of which are fundamentals of “good news reporting” (e.g., Farnsworth & Lichter,
2007; Schudson, 1978). But, to begin with, many thinkers and researchers have
addressed the necessity of reconceptualizing objectivity more as guiding principle for
impartial inquiry than as an absolute rule (Fox & Park, 2006, p. 49). The very nature
of news making and story-telling implies that the world beyond direct experience is
(re)constructed according to “persistent patterns [ . . . ] of selection, emphasis, and
exclusion” (Gitlin, 1980, p. 7). Thus, routines of newsrooms and production tech-
niques of each medium interact with the content resulting in a particular interpretation
of reality (Meyrowitz, 1998). Besides this, the market-oriented model of news produc-
tion and the powerful influence of forces outside newsrooms determine not only what
is published and what is not, but also the axis or angle around which the story is con-
structed (e.g., Herman & Chomsky, 1988; McManus, 1995).
    Most previous research on media bias in the United States has focused on presidential
election campaigns and considered three main sub-dimensions or types of media bias:
gatekeeping bias resulting from the process of filtering and selecting information, which
might benefit one of the parties at the cost of another; coverage bias, or differences in the
proportion of space/time devoted to each side; and statement bias, or subjective, evalua-
tive statements (either positive or negative in tone) about one side (D’Alessio & Allen,
2000, pp. 135-137). Although some studies have found partisan bias in certain situations,
its direction (i.e., who benefits from and who is harmed by the bias) is variable, so bias,
at least in the U.S. electoral context, does not seem to be pervasive (D’Alessio & Allen,
2000; Eveland & Shah, 2003; Niven, 2002). According to this line of research, the grow-
ing public concern about media bias (and, more specifically, the perception of a “liberal
bias” in U.S. mainstream media) seems to have originated more in news self-coverage
about liberal bias than in an actual liberal bias: “The increased claims of media bias
come primarily from conservative elites who have proclaimed a liberal bias that is
viewed as including the entire media industry” (Watts et al., 1999, p. 144).
    More recent studies paint a somewhat different picture. In the United States and
other Western democracies, the general use of the internet for getting news, and the
widespread access to cable television, have given rise to a “fragmented” media envi-
ronment where some news media adapt their content to their users’ political prefer-
ences (Mullainathan & Shleifer, 2005). These highly biased outlets carve out audience
niches that become wrapped “in an insulating media enclave of information and opin-
ion” (Jamieson & Cappella, 2008, p. 4). In the United States, this reinforcing media
space has been dubbed the “echo chamber” (Jamieson & Cappella, 2008). News media
such as Fox News, the Wall Street Journal editorial page, or Limbaugh’s talk radio
show create shared opinion environments where the messages from conservative
political elites (i.e., the Republican Party) are magnified and “echoed,” while alterna-
tive or competing interpretations are silenced (Jamieson & Cappella, 2008, p. 76).
    The matter of media bias is further complicated with psychological variables.
Perceptions on media bias are, in fact, more related to personal attitudes and character-
istics than to the actual media content (Gunther, 1992; Niven, 2002). So, for example,
Ardèvol-Abreu and Gil de Zúñiga                                                     709


people tend to perceive and evaluate the media coverage as “biased against their own
views” (Gunther & Christen, 2002, p. 179). This phenomenon has come to be called
“hostile media perception” (e.g., Gunther, 1992; Vallone, Ross, & Lepper, 1985).
    Whether these perceptions are based on the biased media content, the self-coverage
of liberal bias, or the individuals’ skeptical dispositions, audience assessment of the
good and fair news reporting seems to guide news consumption patterns as much as
media trust does. Some scholars have even talked of a “revival of selective exposure”
(Iyengar & Hahn, 2009, p. 20). Thus, during the 2000 and 2004 U.S. Presidential
Election campaigns, Republican and Democratic partisans tended to avoid mainstream
media they perceived as against their political views, and explored alternative sources
such as local TV news and talk shows (Democrats) or political talk radio, radio news,
and political advertising (Republicans; Pfau, Houston, & Semmler, 2007). Similarly,
perceptions of bias and unfairness in traditional media predict a higher consumption of
Fox News among those who perceive the channel as more tailored to their beliefs
(Morris, 2007). On the contrary, those individuals who see little or no bias in the tra-
ditional media are more likely to consume CNN and other mainstream network news.
According to these previous findings and theoretical explanations, it seems plausible
that overall media bias perceptions negatively predict citizens’ mainstream news con-
sumption levels. Thus our third hypothesis is as follows:

   H3: Editorial media bias perception at Wave 1 is negatively related to traditional
   news media use at Wave 2.

   Although it has been suggested that media bias perception encourages audiences to
consume alternative sources of information, whether this holds true for citizen news
media and social media has not been addressed. Citizen news media are not necessar-
ily “more congenial” to certain political preferences, in the sense that they are not
necessarily biased toward one or the other extreme of the political spectrum as Fox
News is. In addition, social media provide access to both traditional and alternative
news media, so the possible impact of bias perception cannot be easily predicted.
Therefore, the last set of research questions ask,

   RQ5: What is the effect (if any) of editorial media bias perception at Wave 1 on
   citizen news use at Wave 2?
   RQ6: What is the effect (if any) of editorial media bias perception at Wave 1 on
   social media use for news at Wave 2?


Methods
Sample
This study uses two waves of panel data spanning 3 months. Longitudinal studies are
the most suitable for “describing processes over time” (Babbie & Mouton, 2001, p.
104). Because our hypotheses and research questions assume a particular
710                                    Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly 94(3)


causal direction (i.e., that levels of trust in the media and bias perceptions affect media
consumption patterns), a panel study enables to test for time-order effects and to better
explore these causal processes, compared with cross-sectional designs. Respondents
were recruited by the media-polling group Nielsen in the United States from 200,000
previously registered people from all over the country. To improve external validity of
the results, participants of the survey were selected based on quotas derived from the
adult U.S. population, corresponding to age, gender, education, and income. This pro-
cedure minimizes the drawbacks of a convenience sample based only on internet users
(see Bode, Vraga, Borah, & Shah, 2014; Iyengar & Hahn, 2009). In the first wave,
distributed between December 15, 2013 and January 5, 2014, completed question-
naires were obtained from 1,813 persons. The response rate, 34.6% (American
Association of Public Opinion Research [AAPOR], 2011, RR3), was considered
acceptable for online-based surveys (Bosnjak, Das, & Lynn, 2016). In the second
wave of surveys, conducted between February 15 and March 5, 2014, we retained
valid information of 1,024 cases (W2 cooperation rate 57%; W2 total cooperation rate,
COOP2, 19.5% of all eligible respondents ever contacted).
   Overall, our sample is demographically diverse and comparable to the U.S. popula-
tion in terms of gender (49.7% females), age (M = 52.71; SD = 14.72), and race
(77.9% whites). There are, however, some differences between the sample and the
U.S. Census Bureau (2012) regarding age, ethnic/racial composition, and education
level. The sample is slightly older, more educated, and includes fewer Hispanics (see
Saldaña, McGregor, & Gil de Zúñiga, 2015, for details).


Variables of Interest
Social media use for news. Respondents were asked about their frequency of use (1 =
never to 10 = all the time) of Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, Instagram, Tumblr,
Reddit, and LinkedIn for getting news. Two more items asked respondents how often
they used social media “to stay informed about current events and public affairs,” and
“to get news about current events from mainstream media” (10 items averaged scale, W1
Cronbach’s α = .86, M = 1.94, SD = 1.31; W2 Cronbach’s α = .87, M = 1.90, SD = 1.29).

Citizen news use. Although there is a lack of agreement among researchers on what
specific practices should be considered as citizen journalism,1 our measurement aims
to strike a balance between the different interpretations of the concept. Building on
previous studies (for example Kaufhold et al., 2010), this variable taps the frequency
of exposure to news from “citizen news media,” understood as all the news content
whose production stems from a creative effort on the part of the citizen/s (i.e., not only
retweeting, sharing, or commenting on a content item). On a 10-point scale (from 1 =
never to 10 = all the time), respondents separately rated how frequently they get news
from “citizen journalism sites” (e.g., CNN’s iReport, Examiner.com), and “hyperlocal
news sites” (e.g., Patch.com or other sites dedicated to news in their local community;
W1 Spearman-Brown2 ρ = .65; M = 1.91; SD = 1.65; W2 Spearman-Brown ρ = .67; M
= 1.95; SD = 1.67).
Ardèvol-Abreu and Gil de Zúñiga                                                        711


Traditional news use. Respondents separately rated how frequently they use traditional,
mainstream media, including network TV news, national newspapers, cable news,
radio news, and specific cable and satellite channels such as CNN, Fox News, MSNBC,
and BBC America (eight items averaged scale; W1 Cronbach’s α = .73; M = 3.92;
SD = 1.72; W2 Cronbach’s α = .74; M = 3.91; SD = 1.74).

Editorial media bias perception. This measure attempted to capture information about
respondents’ perception regarding the ideals of objectivity, fairness, and balance of
the news content produced by media companies. This measure included three items
concerning respondents’ level of agreement (from 1 = strongly disagree to 10 =
strongly agree) with the following statements: “News companies choose stories
based on what will attract the biggest audience,” “Production techniques can be
used to influence a viewer’s perception,” and “The owner of a media company
influences the content that is produced’ (three items averaged scale; W1 Cronbach’s
α = .91, M = 7.78, SD = 2.28).

Trust in social and citizen media. Although “there is no standardized scale for measuring
trust in the media” (Jackob, 2010, p. 595), media trust was measured building on pre-
vious approaches to the construct (e.g., Jackob, 2010; Jones, 2004; Moy, McCluskey,
McCoy, & Spratt, 2004). Respondents were asked to rate their level of trust (from 1 =
do not trust to 10 = trust completely) in different alternative media. The exact wording
of the questions was as follows: “How much do you trust news from alternative news
media? (e.g., blogs, citizen journalism),” and “How much do you trust news from
Social media sites” (W1 Spearman-Brown ρ = .70; M = 3.56, SD = 1.98).

Trust in traditional media. Similarly to trust in alternative media, participants were
asked about their level of trust in news from “mainstream news media,” and “news
aggregators” (W1 Spearman-Brown ρ = .48; M = 4.99, SD = 1.95).

Control Variables
In order to minimize confounding effects, all models control for the influence of an
exhaustive set of control variables. All of these variables have been shown to be asso-
ciated with either the independent or the dependent variables, or with both, as explained
below.

Political discussion frequency. The frequency of political talk is influenced by the pattern
of media use (Kim, Wyatt, & Katz, 1999; Koch, 1994). Given this relationship with
our dependent variables, our models include discussion frequency as a control. On a
10-point scale, respondents were asked how often they talk about politics or public
affairs online and offline with “spouse or partner,” “family and relatives,” “friends,”
“acquaintances,” “strangers,” “neighbors you know well,” “neighbors you do not
know well,” “coworkers you know well,” and “coworkers you do not know well”
(nine items averaged scale, W1, Cronbach’s α = .87; M = 3.27; SD = 1.74).
712                                     Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly 94(3)


Discussion network size. The number of people with which an individual discusses reg-
ularly has been found to predict the use of different news media, especially social
media use for news (Gil de Zúñiga, 2002). Respondents were asked to estimate, in an
open-ended fashion, the number of people they talked to “face-to-face or over the
phone about politics or public affairs,” and “via the internet, including e-mail, chat
rooms, and social networking sites about politics or public affairs.” We created an
initial index by adding the figures from both items, but the resulting variable was
skewed (W1 M = 4.36; Mdn = 1.00; SD = 16.89; skewness = 10.86). We then used the
natural logarithm to convert the distribution of values to normality (W1 M = .33;
Mdn = .24; SD = .37; skewness = 1.32).

Internal political efficacy. This control variable taps respondents’ self-perception of their
competence and ability to reason and participate in politics. Research of news expo-
sure and efficacy has generally found a positive association between internal efficacy
and informational uses of media (Jung, Kim, & Gil de Zúñiga, 2011; Kenski & Stroud,
2006). On a 10-point scale, participants were asked to rate their level of agreement
with these statements: “I have a good understanding of the important political issues
facing our country,” and “I consider myself well qualified to participate in politics”
(W1, Spearman-Brown ρ = .85; M = 5.34, SD = 2.56).

Political interest. An individual’s level of interest in politics has been shown to be a
strong predictor of news use (see, for example, Tsfati & Cappella, 2003, 2005).
Accordingly, this study controls for the effects of this variable to isolate potential con-
founding effects. Survey respondents were asked to estimate, on a 10-point scale, their
degree of interest in “information about what’s going on in politics and public affairs,”
as well as their level of attention to “information about what’s going on in politics and
public affairs” (two items averaged scale, W1 Spearman-Brown coefficient = .96; M =
6.67, SD = 2.70).

Political knowledge. Prior research has identified the relationship between trust in the
media and political knowledge (Kaufhold et al., 2010), but also between political
knowledge and news use (Tsfati & Cappella, 2003). Participants were asked eight
questions about current political affairs and the functioning of the U.S. political sys-
tem. An additive scale of political knowledge was created after coding correct
responses as “1” and incorrect or missing ones as “0” (W1 Cronbach’s α = .75; M =
4.58, SD = 2.17).

Strength of partisanship. Political ideology and strength of attachment to the major
political parties has been found to predict trust in the media (Jones, 2004; Westley &
Severin, 1964), media bias perceptions (Morris, 2007; Vallone et al., 1985), and media
use and preference (Morris, 2007; Tsfati & Cappella, 2003). Respondents were also
asked to rate their party identification, from “strong Republican” (“1”), through “inde-
pendent” (“6”), to “strong Democrat” (“11”). To create an interval variable measuring
strength of partisanship, we folded the item into a 6-point scale (from 0 = no party
Ardèvol-Abreu and Gil de Zúñiga                                                        713


identification to 5 = total party identification, either with Republicans or Democrats)
(W1, M = 2.10, SD = 1.88).

Socio-demographic variables. The models also controlled for gender, age, race, educa-
tion, and income (for a detailed demographic breakdown, see Saldaña, McGregor, &
Gil de Zúñiga, 2015).

Statistical Analyses
First we checked differences in the mean scores of the variables of interest in Wave 1
and Wave 2. As expected, no significant differences between waves were observed for
trust in traditional media, trust in social and citizen media, editorial media bias percep-
tion, traditional news use, citizen news use, or social media use for news (paired-
samples t tests), so that the sample composition was similar in both waves. These
findings lend support to the notion that our models are robust testing causal order and
it is not caused by measurement error or simple attitudinal individual variability of the
dependent variables in time.
    In order to examine the hypotheses and research questions, this study used three
sets of cross-lagged, autoregressive ordinary least squares regressions, one for each
dependent variable. Also, for comparative purposes, three series of cross-lagged, but
non-autoregressive models were fitted. Analyses were conducted using SPSS version
21.0 and PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2013).


Results
The first hypothesis predicted that trust in traditional media would significantly
increase traditional news use. As shown in Tables 1 and 2 (first column in each table),
empirical support for H1 was not found. Trust in traditional media was positively
related to traditional news use, though the relationship did not reach the borderline of
significance (β = .039, p < .10; see Table 2). Only when previous uses of traditional
news media were disregarded, the effect was positive and significant (β = .205, p <
.001; see non-autoregressive model in Table 1). The model, as Table 2 shows, accounts
for 64.5% of total variance in traditional media use.
   Disaggregated by blocks, “media use” (containing traditional news use in Wave 1)
explained the most part of variance (ΔR2 = .343, p < .001), followed by “sociopolitical
orientations” (ΔR2 = .208, p < .001), “news media trust” (ΔR2 = .048, p < .001), “demo-
graphics” (ΔR2 = .043, p < .001), and “bias perception” (ΔR2 = .003, p < .01). Within
“media use” block, traditional news use (Wave 1; β = .703, p < .001) and social media
use for news (Wave 1; β = .075, p < .01) exerted significant influence on traditional news
use (Wave 2). Those who consume news from traditional media and from social media
will tend to get news from traditional news sources in the future. Strength of partisanship
(β = .038, p < .05), political interest (β = .083, p < .01), and political discussion fre-
quency (β = .055, p < .05) were also predictors of traditional media use within the block
of “sociopolitical orientations.” Those with higher levels of party identification and

political interest, and those who discuss politics more often will tend to consume tradi-
tional, mainstream media in the future. Trust in social and citizen media, within the
fourth block, exerted a negative, but marginally insignificant effect on traditional news
use (β = −.047, p < .10). Thus the study did not find any influence of trust in social and
citizen media on traditional news use (RQ2). Again, only when traditional news media
use in Wave 1 is disregarded, the effect is negatively significant (β = −.121, p < .001; see
non-autoregressive model in Table 1). Finally, consistent with H5, negative perceptions
about media bias (Wave 1) significantly reduce traditional news media consumption

(Wave 2) (β = −.060, p < .01). That is, the more the people perceive news media as
biased, the less they will consume mainstream information in the future.
   Similarly to H1, as the second model in Table 2 shows, the study did not find any
effect of trust in social and citizen media on citizen news use (RQ3). Once the effect
of citizen news use in Wave 1 is controlled, the impact of trust in social and citizen
media on citizen news media use is non-significant (β = .024, ns). Furthermore, and
unexpectedly, trust in traditional news media does not have any effect on citizen news

use either (H2) (β = .029, ns). The whole model explains 36.7% of total variance in
citizen news use. By blocks, “media use” (containing citizen news use in Wave 1)
accounted for the most part of variance (ΔR2 = .172, p < .001), followed by “sociopo-
litical orientations” (ΔR2 = .109, p < .001), “news media trust” (ΔR2 = .046, p < .001),
“demographics” (ΔR2 = .038, p < .001), and “bias perception” (ΔR2 = .002, p < .05).
    Different from the first model, the three variables in W1 within the third block—tra-
ditional news use (β = .105, p < .01), citizen news use (β = .381, p < .001), and social
media for news (β = .138, p < .001)—exerted significant influence on citizen news use
(Wave 2). Within the second block, political discussion frequency (β = .087, p < .05)
and strength of partisanship (β = −.051, p < .05) also showed to have an impact on citi-
zen news use. Those who discuss politics more frequently will be more likely to con-
sume citizen news media in the future. Conversely, both Democrat and Republican
partisans will tend to consume less citizen-created news content. Age, within the first
block, was also related to citizen news use (β = −.061, p < .05). The older the respon-
dents are, the less they will consume alternative news media. Finally, and similarly to
the first model, editorial media bias perception negatively predicted citizen news use
(β = −.053, p < .05) (RQ5). That is, the more the people perceive editorial media as
biased, the less they will consume citizen news media in the future.
    The third regression model (third column in Tables 1 and 2) shows that the impact
of trust in social and citizen media on social media use for news is strong and signifi-
cant, both before (β = .357, p < .001, see Table 1) and after controlling for previous
uses of social media use for news (β = .134, p < .001, see Table 2) (RQ4). Trust in
traditional media, however, showed no significant relationship with social media news
use for news (β = −.018, ns, see Table 2) (RQ1). As Table 2 shows, the model explains
56.5% of total variance in social media use for news. Again, “media use” (which
includes social media use in W1) accounted for the most part of variance (ΔR2 = .237,
p < .001), followed by “sociopolitical orientations” (ΔR2 = .099, p < .001), “news
media trust” (ΔR2 = .126, p < .001), “demographics” (ΔR2 = .098, p < .001), and “bias
perception” (ΔR2 = .007, p < .001).
    Within the third block of variables, only previous uses of social media for news (β =
.610, p < .001) positively predicted future uses of social media for news. Discussion
network size, on the second block, also had a positive effect on future uses of social
media for news (β = .071, p < .01). Those who discuss politics with a larger number of
persons will be more likely to consume news via social media. Within “demographics,”
age (β = −.069, p < .01) and race (1 = White) (β = −.045, p < .05) negatively predicted
alternative news use. Older respondents and Whites tend to consume less news via social
media. Finally, editorial media bias perception, once again, negatively predicted social
media use for news (β = −.088, p < .001) (RQ6). The more the people perceive editorial
media as biased, the less they will consume news via social media in the future.


Discussion and Conclusions
This study improves our understanding of the mutual relationships between trust in the
media, perceived media bias, and media use. To the best of the authors’ knowledge,
Ardèvol-Abreu and Gil de Zúñiga                                                           717


this is the first work to separately examine the impact of trust in traditional versus
social and citizen media in predicting news media use patterns. Additionally, editorial
media bias perception was also included in the models to ascertain whether this vari-
able has an effect on news media use habits that extends beyond trust in the media.
    To some extent, our findings contradict results from previous studies. We found
that, once the analyses control for previous news media uses, the effects of trust in
traditional media disappear. In other words, trust in traditional media does no predict
either traditional, citizen, or social media use for news. To date, the effects of trust in
the media on media use have recurrently been found to be “only modest, although
statistically significant” (Tsfati & Cappella, 2005, p. 252). Most of previous studies,
however, rely on cross-sectional data, which limits the quality of the evidence with
regard to causal inference. This study explores these relationships on the basis of lon-
gitudinal survey data, which is more suitable for causal inference and also affords the
possibility of stricter statistical analyses.
    One explanation for the lack of effects of trust in traditional media could lie in differ-
ent motivations for using news media. As suggested by previous studies, social needs,
need for entertainment, or need for cognition could explain the modest—or, in this case,
the lack of—association between trust in traditional media and news use (Tsfati, 2003;
Tsfati & Cappella, 2005). An individual might choose to get news from a source they do
not trust, just to stay in touch with the mainstream interpretation of reality, to have a topic
of conversation to talk with their coworkers, or simply to pass the time.
    A complementary explanation has to do with the multidimensional character of
trust in the media (Kohring & Matthes, 2007), and connects our findings about trust
and bias perceptions. If we accept the idea that media trust is a multidimensional con-
struct, it is reasonable to expect that each of the sub-dimensions will affect media use
differently. It may be the case, for example, that some of the dimensions do not affect
media consumption at all, while others do greatly, so that the overall effect is diluted.
And this is where bias perceptions come in. Despite the absence of a widely accepted
measure of trust in the media (Kohring & Matthes, 2007; Self, 1996), most of previous
approaches to the concept include a component of lack of bias, impartiality, objectiv-
ity, or accuracy (Gaziano & McGrath, 1986; Hovland et al., 1953; Jacobson, 1969;
Kohring & Matthes, 2007). All these notions are remarkably similar to the notion of
bias perception as operationalized in this study. Therefore, bias perception may well
be the key dimension of how and why trust in previous studies explained media expo-
sure, as suggested by our results. Thus, once the effect of bias perceptions is ruled out,
trust in traditional media would lose its predictive power.
    The pattern of influence of trust in citizen and social media on media use is some-
what different. Contrary to trust in traditional media, trust in citizen media does seem to
predict specific news media uses. In the autoregressive models, trust in citizen and
social media has no effect on traditional or citizen news use, though it retains a strong,
positive influence on social media use for news. A possible explanation for this last
finding is that the positive effect of trust in social and citizen media on social media use
for news may also capture some of the exposure to citizen and alternative media. That
is, those who trust information from alternative media (i.e., blogs and citizen media) are
718                                    Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly 94(3)


using social media as an entry gate to those alternative sources. The fact that most of the
alternative information and citizen-generated news are distributed through social media
(Newman et al., 2012) gives support to this interpretation. Indeed, we empirically tested
this possibility a posteriori and found that this may be the case. Thus, we estimated the
effect of trust in social and citizen media (W1) on citizen news use (W2) through social
media use for news (W1). We found that social media use does mediate this relationship
(see Notes section for the estimates of the indirect effect).3
    Our findings also suggest that variables other than trust in the media drive media
use patterns in these data. Specifically, results show that perceived media bias has a
negative effect on all news use without distinction between news in traditional, citizen,
or social media. It is possible that perceived bias moved citizens toward different,
alternative sources of information, which they consider to be less biased or free of
bias. These results, however, suggest otherwise. Perceived media bias has detrimental
effects on news use, regardless of the type of news media. Given the relevant role of
journalism and the media for the democratic process (Gil de Zúñiga & Hinsley, 2013),
these results should be viewed with some concern. The problem is not so much the
deleterious impact of perceived media bias on traditional media use, but the wide-
spread negative effect on all forms of news consumption. Not even more alternative
ways of acquiring information such as citizen journalism escapes this trend. One plau-
sible explanation for this is that the public may not perceive citizen media platforms as
free of the constraints and biases derived from private ownership. In fact, in most
cases—at least in the U.S. context—they might be not. For instance, at the time of data
collection, AOL was selling Patch.com to Hale Global, which immediately laid off
hundreds of employees and collaborators (Kaufman, 2014). Worse, plagiarism and the
use of fictional bylines for news stories led to the failure of the outsourced, low-cost
hyperlocal journalism model tested by Journatic (Sonderman, 2012).
    The findings of this study have to be interpreted with caution, as there are a number
of limitations to consider. The first concerns the time lag between the two waves (3
months). Our analyses show significant causal effects of our independent variables of
interest over the dependent variables, even when controlling (autoregressive models)
for prior individual levels of the dependent variables in Time 1. These changes are
consistent with our expectations and theoretical explanations, and the effects remain
significant even after introducing a large number of control variables. There is always
a trade-off between time lag and attrition rate in panel studies, and we consider that
this study strikes the right balance between both. With a larger time frame between
waves, one could reasonably expect effects to be stronger, but at the risk of an inac-
ceptable reduction in the response rate (see Bucy & Holbert, 2014; Kessler &
Greenberg, 1981). Further research could, however, try to extend the time frame
between waves to ensure that the effects are maintained or even increased. Second,
although one can be reasonably sure that these findings are generalizable to the U.S.
population, our results are based on panel data from one country. Future research
should replicate this study in different societies with different social and political
structures. Also, different countries may encompass distinct media systems so this call
is relevant and in dire need in our discipline.
Ardèvol-Abreu and Gil de Zúñiga                                                               719


    Another limitation of this study comes from the use of an online survey. Although
the demographic characteristics of our samples are comparable with the U.S. Census,
participants were drawn from an opt-in panel and not from the general population. The
use of online panels consisting of volunteer participants has become increasingly fre-
quent in communication research (see, for example, Beam, 2014; Davis, Nonnemaker,
Duke, & Farrelly, 2012; Gil de Zúñiga & Valenzuela, 2010), but, strictly speaking,
samples obtained by these means are not random. However, given the diversity of the
respondents and the large number of control variables used in all models, we can be
reasonably sure about the external validity of our findings.
    Finally, some qualifications regarding our measures of trust should also be noted.
As explained above, trust in the media is a multidimensional construct. This study
captured respondents’ levels of trust in news from different media platforms: trust in
traditional media and trust in citizen/social media. Within this context, a potential
confound is that people may be also consuming “traditional media” on social media
and thus, some of the trust in social media may also relate to that behavior. Future stud-
ies should attempt to better capture these nuances and systematically pinpoint how
trust in news is built, particularly in social media. Likewise, this suggestion for future
research also remains when applied to trust in traditional media: one can trust the news
from MSNBC but not from Fox News, or vice versa. Still, our theoretical distinction
(between trust in traditional, citizen, and social media news) constitutes a step forward
in that direction.
    Despite these limitations, this article makes important theoretical and empirical
contributions in regard to the relationships between trust in the media, media bias
perceptions, and media use. In brief, the study provides empirical evidence on the
small role played by trust in the media (whether in traditional or alternative ones) in
explaining media consumption patterns. What does appear certain is that the percep-
tion that the news is biased has a generalized detrimental effect on news media use,
whether via traditional, alternative, or social media. Based on these findings, future
research should continue to seek other variables and mechanism that, beyond or
together with trust in the media, predict news media exposure patterns.
