FULL-LENGTH REPORT                       Background and aims: Social media use has become a ubiquitous part of society, with 3.8 billion users
                                         worldwide. While research has shown that there are positive aspects to social media engagement (e.g.
                                         feelings of social connectedness and wellbeing), much of the focus has been on the negative mental
                                         health outcomes which are associated with excessive use (e.g. higher levels of depression/anxiety). While
                                         the evidence to support such negative associations is mixed, there is a growing debate within the
                                         literature as to whether excessive levels of social media use should become a clinically defined addictive
                                         behaviour. Methods: Here we assess whether one hallmark of addiction, the priority processing of
                                         addiction related stimuli known as an ‘attentional bias’, is evident in a group of social media users (N 5
                                         100). Using mock iPhone displays, we test whether social media stimuli preferentially capture users’
                                         attention and whether the level of bias can be predicted by platform use (self-report, objective
                                         smartphone usage data), and whether it is associated with scores on established measures of social
                                         media engagement (SMES) and social media ‘addiction’ severity scales (BSNAS, SMAQ). Results: Our
                                         findings do not provide support for a social media specific attentional bias. While there was a large
                                         range of individual differences in our measures of use, engagement, and ‘addictive’ severity, these were
                                         not predictive of, or associated with, individual differences in the magnitude of attentional capture by
                                         social media stimuli. Conclusions: More research is required before social media use can be definitively
                                         placed within an addiction framework.

                                         There are currently 3.8 billion active social media users (Statista, 2020). With increased
                                         internet connectivity occurring across the world, individuals now have access to a suite of
                                         social media platforms (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat) which provide news,
                                         information, entertainment, an opportunity to post photos, express opinion, seek compan-
                                         ionship, and maintain networks of friends and family (Ryan, Chester, Reece, & Xenos, 2014;
                                         Whiting & Williams, 2013). While engagement with social media can enhance feelings of

                                         social media use is increasingly being characterised as an addictive behaviour (Grifﬁths, 2000;

                                         However, it has not yet been recognised as such by the DSM-5 (APA, 2013) or ICD-11
