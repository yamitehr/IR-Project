Abstract
Media bias, i.e., slanted news coverage, can strongly impact the public perception of the reported topics. In the social sciences,
research over the past decades has developed comprehensive models to describe media bias and effective, yet often manual
and thus cumbersome, methods for analysis. In contrast, in computer science fast, automated, and scalable methods are
available, but few approaches systematically analyze media bias. The models used to analyze media bias in computer science
tend to be simpler compared to models established in the social sciences, and do not necessarily address the most pressing
substantial questions, despite technically superior approaches. Computer science research on media bias thus stands to profit
from a closer integration of models for the study of media bias developed in the social sciences with automated methods from
computer science. This article first establishes a shared conceptual understanding by mapping the state of the art from the
social sciences to a framework, which can be targeted by approaches from computer science. Next, we investigate different
forms of media bias and review how each form is analyzed in the social sciences. For each form, we then discuss methods
from computer science suitable to (semi-)automate the corresponding analysis. Our review suggests that suitable, automated
methods from computer science, primarily in the realm of natural language processing, are already available for each of the
discussed forms of media bias, opening multiple directions for promising further research in computer science in this area.
